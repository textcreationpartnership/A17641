            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Reader, blame not this thyng I beſech thee, which I haue done in this plaine and rude ſort, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of the ſimple and vnlearned: whom I did thinke vnable to comprehende in theyr myndes, and to apply vnto their conſciences theſe learned Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries of this diuine Caluine, vnles they were ſomethyng ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> expoſitions of the Hebrue wordes, which would haue bene ſomethyng darke in our la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, omitted. Wherfore, as I do profeſſe my ſelfe to bee one of his ſcholers, and do prayſe God for the ſame more then for any earthly matter: ſo do I not of arrogancie alter or chaunge any thing in his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynges. But becauſe I do know right well that if he were alyue hym ſelfe, he would ſuffer all his doings to be applyed to the commoditie of the Church: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I do offer his trauayles to the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of our Engliſh nation, who are deſirous of the ſame, I do ſo preſent them as may be moſt comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their conſcience, and leaſt tedious to ſuch ſimple perſons as are not able to comprehend all his

And this abbrydge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do I make but in the two firſt Chapters and in few places beſides: puttyng into print at this preſent, the one halfe of the booke of Daniell, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynyng the firſt vj. Chapiters, which do treate of the particular hyſtories wrought by God in hys tyme, and therfore ſemeth vnto me farre diuerſe from the latter vj. Chapters: wherin he prophecieth of all thynges that ſhould come vnto the elect peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vntill the commyng of Meſsias, and toucheth alſo ſome thynges that be generall vnto all, euen to the end of the world. The which latter part alſo I do meane (by Gods grace) to publiſh for the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our nation in theſe obſcure Prophecies, if I can perceaue this former trauayle to be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the godly, which is my deſire, and whom I do exhorte in the Lord, to read the Scriptures attentyuely, to meditate the ſame diligently, to pray continually.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough theſe ſixe and twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty yeares wholly I haue not vnwillyngly wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted that our natiue countrey, whoſe beauty doth entice ſo many ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers from farre to come vnto it, becauſe I had no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite nor deſire to dwell in that land whence Gods truth, pure Religion, and the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of eternall ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was baniſhed, forth of the which Chriſts kyngdome was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently driuen, neither yet at this day do I greatly deſyre the ſame: yet to forget the people and nation of whom I was borne, it were neither any poynt of humanity, neither lawful ſo to do. And I do ſuppoſe that I haue with playne proofes declared how carefully and earneſtly I haue deſired to profit our countreymen: vnto whom it may be that myne abſence hath bene profitable whiles that by my ſtudy and trauayle they haue receiued more fruite. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration of the which commodity hath not onely wyped away all grief, but hath made myne exile ſwete and comfortable. Wherefore ſeyng all this long tyme I haue laboured publikely to profite my cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and haue not ceaſſed priuatly alſo to ſtyrre vp the ſlouthful, to pricke forward the ſluggiſh, to encourage the fearefull, to exhorte the doubtfull weakelynges vnto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeueraunce: I thought it now my duety in this daungerous tyme, not to ſlake my diligence towardes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, eſpecially God geuing me ſo good occaſion to do it. For when my Lectures wherin I dyd interpretate Daniels Prophecies ſhould come abroad, nothyng could haue come to hand more aptly, then hereby to ſhew vnto you deare brethren in this glaſſe, how y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God willing to proue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fayth of his at this time with diuerſe exerciſes, hath prouided by his maruelous wiſedome, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme and eſtabliſh their myndes with old examples, leſt they
<pb facs="tcp:7787:4"/> ſhould at any tyme faynt, beyng ſhaken with moſt greuous ſtormes and tempeſtes, or at leaſt if they ſhould at ſometyme come into any doubtfull diſtreſſe, that they ſhould not fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in the ende. For though there be appoynted to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes of God a courſe or race beſet with many daungers and impedimentes: yet who ſoeuer ſhall diligently read and conſider this booke, he ſhall finde therin conteyned, what ſo euer is apte and meete to direct and guyde hym that is not ſlouthfull but forward, from the begynnyng to the end of hys race: and the good and ſtoute champions ſhall know by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that they are ſufficiently armed to the combate.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all an hiſtory, though lamentable, yet very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table doth offer it ſelfe, that Daniel and hys companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were caryed into captiuity whiles the Kyngdome and Prieſthode continued: as though God had giuen vp to extreme calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and miſery the chief floure of the choſen people. And what at the firſt vew can be thought more vnmete, then that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren endued as it were with Angelical vertues, ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as a ſpoyle, and made ſlaues to a proude Conquerer, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the moſt wicked men and proude contemners of God dyd remaine at home ſafe and ſound? Is this the reward of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes and of an innocent lyfe, whiles that the wicked flatter them ſelues becauſe they eſcape vnpuniſhed, that the Saintes &amp; Godly ſhould ſuffer the puniſhment which they had deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued? Howbeit here do we ſee as in a lyuely image, that God when hee ſpareth and pardoneth the moſt wicked for a ſpace, doth try hys ſeruauntes lyke gold and ſiluer, leſt it ſhould greue vs to be caſt into the fornace of triall or fynyng fyre, whiles that prophane perſons do lyue in reſt at pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Secondly there foloweth an example of more then mans wiſedome, and of a ſingular continency, with an heroicall ſtoutnes of mynde, whiles that thoſe godly young me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beyng tempted in that te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der age with courtly delicates, do not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſe ouer without regarde, the daynties that were offered them, through their temperancy: but becauſe they perceiued them ſelues to be craftely aſſaulted that they might fal by litle and litle from the pure worſhip of God: to the ente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that they might rid them ſelues from theſe ſnares of Sathan, they do boldly and conſtantly deſpiſe, not without great daunger of death, the honor embrued with poyſon.</p>
            <p>There doth folow a cruell and more fearefull co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bate, with a notable example of an incredible and meruelous conſtancy, whiles that the companions of Daniell are not moued with
<pb facs="tcp:7787:4"/> cruell threatnynges to pollute them ſelues with the worſhyp of the image, &amp; at the length are ready to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the pure wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyp of GOD, not onely by their owne bloud, but alſo by the ſufferyng of moſt horrible tormentes. As for the goodnes of God that ſhyneth forth in the end of this tragedy, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profitable to arme vs with an inuincible fayth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.</p>
            <p>After this there doth folow the lyke battaile and victory of Daniel hym ſelfe, whiles that he had rather to be caſt to the ragyng Lyons, then to abſteine but three dayes from an open profeſſion of hys fayth, leſt by deceitfull diſſimulation he might proſtitute the holy name of God, to the deriſion of the wicked: and he beyng deliuered forth of the denne, as it were drawen forth of the graue moſt miraculouſly, triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pheth ouer Sathan and his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>federates. Heare come not forth any Philoſophers, which can diſpute ſubtily and cunnyngly of vertues in their ſtudyes when they are quyet: but here haue we the infatigable conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of holy men in the exerciſe of true holynes, to ſtyrre vs vp with open cry to folow them. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnles we be altogether vncapable of doctrine, we muſt learne of thoſe Scholemaſters, diligently to take hede, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Sathan lay hys baytes of flattery, that we be not ſnared therewith: or if that he aſſayle vs with violence, that we may repulſe and breake hys aſſaultes with a bold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of death and all daungers. If any man will make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, that the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of both theſe deliuerau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces that we haue named, are rare: I do graunt that God doth not alwayes ſtretch forth his hand from the heauens, to ſaue hys in lyke ſort, but (which is ſufficient for vs) he hath hereby teſtified that he will be the faithfull guerdon and keper of our lyfe ſo oft as it ſhall be in any daunger, and that we are not expoſed to the luſtes of the wicked, but that God can aſſuage their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and outragious enterpriſes when he ſeeth it good. But we may not onely looke vpon the end and ſucceſſe, but we muſt behold how boldly &amp; courageouſly theſe holy men haue offered them ſelues to death for the defence of Gods glory, neither doth their prompt and ready myndes in offeryng them ſelues as ſacrifices, deſerue leſſe prayſe becauſe they were deliuered.</p>
            <p>Now, amongeſt how many ſtyrres and ſtormes was the Prophet toſſed thoſe <hi>70.</hi> yeares that he lyued in Captiuity, it will be good to conſider. He was ſo well treated of no kyng as he was of <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> whom he yet found a ragyng
<pb facs="tcp:7787:5"/> beaſt. The other were more cruell, whiles by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſodaine death of <hi>Balſazar</hi> and the wynnyng of the Citie, he was brought vnder new Lordes, the <hi>Perſians</hi> and the <hi>Medes.</hi> Who fiercely breakyng in like cruell enemyes, as they made all afrayde, ſo is there no doubt but that they wounded his heart. And though he were wel vſed of <hi>Darius,</hi> ſo that that ſeruitude was tolerable: yet through the enuy and curſed conſpiracy of the noble me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he was then in moſt daunger. Howbeit as he was more carefull for the commune ſafety of the Church then for his owne quietnes, in what ſorow was it like that he remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and with how great grief was he troubled, when that preſent ſtate dyd ſhew none end of the cruell oppreſſion of that miſerable people? He did depend aſſuredly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of Ieremy. But this was an incomparable pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and conſtancy, that his hope dyd not languiſh nor decay beyng ſo long differed, yea that it was not vtterly drowned beyng drawen through ſo many ragyng floudes and tempeſtes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch ſondry ſortes.</p>
            <p>Now come I to the Prophecies, wherof the former were ſent vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Babilonians,</hi> partly becauſe God would adourne his ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with certaine ſpeciall markes which ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell that moſt proude nation, though now in conqueſt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence and honour hym, partly becauſe it was conuenient that his name ſhould be had in reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce amongeſt thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane perſons, that beyng in authoritie he might exerciſe the office of a Prophet more freely towardes hys owne nation. And after that his name was famous amongſt the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> God committed vnto hym Prophecies of great importance, which ſhould peculiarly belong to the elect people: but God dyd ſo apply them to the vſe and commoditie of the auncient people, that they ſhould both mitigate the ſorowes with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable remedyes, and comfirme the waueryng myndes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the commyng of Chriſt, and alſo he had no leſſe regarde of our tymes. For that which he dyd ſpeake before of the tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and vaniſhyng ſhew of the Monarchies and of the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtyng ſtability of Chriſtes kyngdome, is no leſſe profitable to be knowne of vs this day then of old. For God declareth that earthly power which is not founded in Chriſt, is tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and he threatneth a ſodeine ruine to all kyngdomes which ſet them ſelues vp in pride, to obſcure or hynder the glory of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The Kynges that now reigne in ſo great kyngdomes (vnles they willyngly come vnder Chriſtes dominion) ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:7787:5"/> feele in the end by dolefull experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that this horrible iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth alſo apperteine vnto them. For what is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable then to robbe hym of his right and authoritie, by whoſe protection their dignitie is preſerued? yet do we ſee how few of that number do receiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sonne of God offering hym ſelfe vnto them, yea how they buſie them ſelues, how they ſeeke all ſhiftes and try all extremities, rather then they will ſuffer hym to enter into their borders: and many of their Counſellours diligently apply their whole induſtry, ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and ſtudy to ſhut vp all paſſages. And yet in the meane ſeaſon, that they pretende the name of Chriſtianity, and do boaſt them ſelues the chief defenders of the Catholicke faith, it may eaſely bee confuted as a vayne bablyng, if it be once knowne what the kyngdome of Chriſt is by a true and right definition. For the ſcepter of his kyngdome or hys throne is nothyng els but the doctrine of the Goſpell, neither doth hys Maieſty ſhyne any where els, neither doth he otherwayes atteine his empire, then where all, both high and low, with quyte myndes to learne lyke ſhepe, do heare his voyce and folow whether ſo euer he calleth. But they do not onely eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywhere reiect this doctrine, wherin true Religion and the lawfull worſhip of God is conteined, wherin the euerlaſtyng ſaluation of man and the true felicitie conſiſteth, but they ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe it and driue it farre from them with manaces and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, with fire and with ſword, and leaue no force vnattemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to driue it forth of their borders. And what a blindnes is this and how monſtruous, that they whom the onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Sonne of God doth call moſt louyngly vnto him ſelfe, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not abide to receaue him and to imbrace him? But many (ſuch is their pride) thinke their authoritie nothyng if they ſubmit their ſcepters to the hye Kyng. Others will not ſuffer theyr luſtes to be brideled: and as hypocriſy doth blinde the wittes of them all, they deſire darknes and are afrayd to be drawen forth into the light. Yet is there no more wicked peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the feare which <hi>Herode</hi> had: as though he would take away earthly dominions from the Monarches, which offereth the heauenly kyngdome to euery one of the leaſt and pooreſt of the people. The next is, that whiles one doth looke at the doynges of an other, their mutuall league doth reteine them all faſt bound vnder the yoke of impiety with a deadly knot. For if they would earneſtly apply their mynde to enquire what is truth and right, yea though they would but onely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their eyes, the knowledge therof were euident. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:7787:6"/> this is perceiued vſually for the moſt part, when Chriſt ſpringeth forth with his Goſpell, that alſo great ſtyrres do aryſe: vnder an honeſt pretence they caſt away the heauenly doctrine, to prouide for publike tranquillity.</p>
            <p>I muſt graunt in deede, that ſuch alterations &amp; chaunges as do engender publicke diſturbance may be iudged odious: but God hath great iniury offered vnles we attribute thus much to his power, that he can eſtabliſh the kyngdome of his ſonne, and aſſuage all tumultes that boyle forth agaynſt him. Although heauen and earth ſhould rolle together, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyp of God is farre more precious, then that the leaſt dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing therof can be recompenſed with any ranſome. How be it they do burden the Goſpell with a falſe ſclander, which do imagine that it is the matter &amp; cauſe of tumultes and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roares. It is true in dede that God doth therein thunder with the vehemency of his word, wherby he ſhaketh the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and the earth: but whiles the Prophet bryngeth in this ſentence to commend the word and to bryng credit therunto, that ſhakyng is bleſſed and much to be wiſhed. And aſſuredly vnles Gods glory be ſet aloft in his due place, whiles all fleſh be humbled and brought downe, the pride of men which doth lift vp it ſelfe agaynſt it, will neuer giue place but forced and throwne downe by the ſtrong and mighty hand of God. And if ſo be that the earth trembled at the publiſhyng of the law,<note place="margin">Exo. 19.18</note> it is no maruaile if the power and office of the Goſpell appeare more gliſteryng and glorious. Wherfore we ought more louyngly to embrace the Goſpell, which whiles it ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the dead from the helles, and openeth the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to them that were vnworthy to lyue vpon the earth, it ſheweth a ſtraunge power and vertue, as though all the elementes dyd agree to our ſaluation.</p>
            <p>But loe, the tumultes and tempeſtes do ſpryng forth of an other fountaine: becauſe that ſome tymes the nobility and ſuch as are in hygh honor in the world, do not willyngly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the yoke of Chriſt: ſometymes the fooliſh multitude ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth what ſoeuer is for ſaluation, before they haue any taſte what it is: and part like porkes delite them ſelues in their filthynes. And others, as though they were enraged with infernal furies, are outragious in ſlaughters. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil doth pricke forth thoſe that he hath, wholly to be his ſlaues with moſt exceſſiue fury and outrage, to bryng all to hurly burly. Hereof commeth the ſoundyng of the trumpets, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of come battailes and warres, whiles that <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> that
<pb facs="tcp:7787:6"/> Prelate of <hi>Rome,</hi> with hys red and bloudy route and horned beaſtes, rageth ſo fiercely agaynſt Chriſt and ſeketh for helpe on euery ſide of his filthy Clergy, the which altogether al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be not fedde in like daynty ſort, yet doth it eate browys and collaps out of the ſame pot, and many hungry companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s flye vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to offer their ſeruice. A great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the iudges which were wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſtuffe their bellyes with Idolatrous feaſtes, do fight for their kitchyns &amp; bellycheare: but chiefly the deuill ſendeth raylers out of the cloyſters of Monkes and Friers and forth of the dennes of dimſicall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, who are like bellowes to kindle the fire.</p>
            <p>I do paſſe ouer the priuy craftes and wicked conſpiracies, wherof they can be the beſt witneſſes vnto me, that are the greateſt enemies to Religion. I name no man: it is enough to haue pointed them with the finger, who are but ouer well knowne. It is no maruaile though they which depend of the chaungeable ſtate and the diuerſe iſhue of thynges, continue doubtfull in this confuſed inuaſion of ſo many beaſtes. But they reiect the blame of their infidelity iniuſtly and wickedly vpon the holy Goſpell of Chriſt. Let vs graunt that all hell with the infernall furies do enter into battayle: will God ſit idle in the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to forſake and betray his owne cauſe? And when he ſhall ſtand vp agaynſt them, can the craftes of men be they neuer ſo ſubtill, or yet their forces be they neuer ſo great, let God to haue the victory? The Pope, they ſay, will bryng with hym a long trayne of confederates. It is a iuſt reward of incredulity, to tremble at the ſounde of the fall of the leafe. And what ſay you, vnwiſe and vnprouident coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaylers? let Chriſt go that no new ſtraungenes do trouble vs. Therfore ſhall you perceaue ſhortly after this, how much better it had bene to haue God mercyfull, and deſpiſyng all vayne terrours, to reſt vpon his protection, then to prouoke hym to open warre, leſt they ſhould offend and diſpleaſe the euill and wicked ſpirites. Surely when all thynges are exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to the vttermoſt by the Popes defenders, the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which hetherto hath reigned, is none other but an euill thyng well and cunnyngly layd vp and placed, which they thinke ought not to be ſtyrred, becauſe it ſemeth that it can not be touched without ſome loſſe and detriment. But vnto them which deſire Gods glory, and which are ſetled in true Religion, there muſt be a farre contrary purpoſe, that is, that they do ſo offer their labours vnto God, that they commit all the iſhues therof to his prouidence, who if he had promiſed
<pb facs="tcp:7787:7"/> nothyng vnto vs, peraduenture there might be ſome iuſt cauſe to feare and continually to doubt: but ſeing that he hath ſo oft teſtified that hys aſſiſtance ſhall neuer fayle in the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng forth of the kyngdome of his Chriſt, it is the onely way to do well to ſettle our ſelues in this confidence.</p>
            <p>Now it is your partes good brethren, as farre as euery mans power and office ſhall lead hym, to be carefull with all his harte, that true Religion may recouer hys pure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtate. I nede not to rehearſe how diligently hetherto I haue endeuored my ſelfe to cut of all occaſions of tumultes: ſo that I haue the aungels and you all my witneſſes before the hye iudge, that the faulte was not in me that the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt hath not had a peaceable procedyng without any hinderance: and I ſuppoſe that my diligence hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng profited, that priuate men ſhould not paſſe theyr boundes. Now, although God by his merueilous power hath ſpread the reſtoryng of the Church farther then I durſt hope for it,<note place="margin">Luc. 21.19</note> yet is it mete to remember what Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth his ſcholers, euen to poſſeſſe their ſoules in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. Vnto the which purpoſe alſo the viſion of Daniel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayneth: that the ſtone wherby all the kyngdomes which fought agaynſt God were broken, was not formed nor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned by mans hand: and though it were rude and vnpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, yet dyd it grow into a great mountaine. Of the which thyng I thought good to admoniſh you, that amongeſt the thondryng threatnyngs, you ſhould quietly wayte that theſe empty cloudes may be driuen away by the heauenly power, and ſo vaniſh. Yet am I not ignoraunt (to paſſe ouer the fires of thirty yeares) what vnworthy troubles ye haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer theſe laſt ſixe monethes: how ofte in ſundry places the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous people haue broken into your aſſemblyes: how oft you haue bene aſſaulted with ſtones and with ſwordes: how your enemyes haue layne in wayte for you, that they might oppreſſe your peaceable congregations with ſuddayn force at vnwares: how ſome haue bene ſlayne in their owne houſes, ſome in the hye wayes: how the bodyes of the dead haue bene trailed in deriſion, the wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rauiſhed, many men wounded, one woman great with child and her child alſo thruſt through, the houſes broken and pulled downe.</p>
            <p>But although more cruell thynges were yet at hand, that you may declare your ſelues the Diſciples of Chriſt rightly inſtructed in his ſchole, you muſt indeuour your ſelues that no rage of the wicked which deale ſo outragiouſly, do driue
<pb facs="tcp:7787:7"/> you from that moderation whereby hetherto onely they haue bene ouercome and diſapoynted. And if ſo be that the length of tyme do make you weary, remember oftentymes that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Prophecy, in the which the condition of the Church was liuely expreſſed. God declared then vnto his Prophet what battayles, what troubles, what griefes and perils the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhould ſuffer from the end of their captiuity and ioyfull returning into their countrey, vntill the commyng of Chriſt. Now y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> likenes of times cauſeth the ſame thyngs to be agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vnto vs, and therfore may be applyed to our vſe. <hi>Daniel</hi> reioyced for the miſerable Church which had ben long drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a depe floude of miſeries, when he collected by the count of the yeares, that the day of deliueraunce ſpoken of by <hi>Ieremy</hi> the Prophet was at hand.<note place="margin">Iere. 25. c. 12. &amp;. 29.10.</note> Howbeit he had an aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that the ſtate of the people ſhould be more greuous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that liberty were reſtored, ſo that they ſhould ſcantly haue any breathyng tyme from their continuall miſeries. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> continued hys hope ſeuenty yeares not without great and bitter ſorow and many griefes: but now God increaſing the tyme ſeuenfold, doth ſtrike hym to the heart, as it were with a deadly wound. Neither doth he yet onely pronounce that the people ſhould be ſubiect to new troubles, when after long tyme they beyng reſtored had gathered ſtrength, had built their Citie and Temple: but in the firſt begynnyng of their mirth, when they had ſcarce taſted the ſwetenes of the comfort, he doth appointe them vnto miſery. Now, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng the calamities which folowed ſoone after (wherof there is a long rehearſall) ſeyng we tremble at the hearyng onely of them, how dolefull and bitter do we thinke they were to the rude people, how horrible and fearefull a ſpectacle was it to ſee the temple prophaned by the bold malice of a curſed ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, the ſacrifices mixed with filthy pollutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in deſpite, and all the bookes of the law to be burned to deſtroy all Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and all thoſe to be drawen to the ſame fire, who ſoeuer dyd confeſſe playnly and conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly that they would perſeuere and continue in the worſhyp of God? How could the tender and weake behold this without great feare of heart? And this was the purpoſe of the tyraunt, that cruelty ſhould driue the weakelynges to fall from their Religion. Vnder the <hi>Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees</hi> there ſemed ſome releaſe to be offered, the which yet was ſtraight after deformed with moſt cruel ſlaughters, and neuer wanted ſorrow and grief. For where as their enemy did farre excell them both in multitude and warlike munition, they all
<pb facs="tcp:7787:8"/> thought nothyng better which had taken weapons for the defence of the Church, then to hide them ſelues in the dennes of wild beaſtes, or to wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der in wildernes with great pouerty and ſcarcity of all thynges.</p>
            <p>There was alſo an other kynde of temptation, that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked hipocrites, vnder a falſe prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of zeale (as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſayth) did ioyne them ſelues to <hi>Iudas</hi> and his brethren. By the which ſubtilty Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpotted the gariſons that <hi>Iudas</hi> had collected, with great infamy, as though they had ben a bande of theues and robbers. But nothyng was more lamentable vnto good men, then to ſee the Prieſtes them ſelues, as euery man was caried with hys ambition, to betray the Church and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of God with wicked packyngs and practiſes. Neither was that holy office onely ſold and made a marchandiſe, but it was bought with mutuall ſlaughter and parricides. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of came it that all ſtates of men, all though Circumciſion and ſacrifices were in vſe, were polluted in the ende through the manifold corruptions which ſpred euery where without puniſhment: that it was a ſtraunge wonder to wayte for the kyngdome of God when Chriſt came into the world, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few are therfore named with this commendation. If now in that miſerable deformity of the Church, in the manifold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations, amongſt thoſe great terrours, the ſpoylyng of their countreys, the robbyng of houſes, and amongeſt the dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers of death the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> hath ſuſteined godly mindes, when as Religion was yet wrapped in darke ſhadowes, and the doctrine almoſt extinguiſhed, and the Prieſts themſelues beyng degenerate dyd tread all holy thynges vnder foote: how ſhamefull ſhall our tender weakenes be, vnles this cleare light of the Goſpell, in the which God hath ſhewed his fatherly face towardes vs, lift vs vp aboue all impediments, and ſtabliſh vs with a conſtancy that can not bee wearied? For as there is no doubt but that the ſeruauntes of God then dyd apply vnto their age, to mitigate the ſorowes of their preſent miſeryes, all ſuch things as were ſpoken by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes of the Babilonicall captiuity: ſo is it our part to haue our eyes bent vpon the miſeries of our fathers, that we refuſe not to be gathered vnto that Church, vnto whom it is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:<note place="margin">Iſa. 54.11. Pſa. 129.1 2.3.4.</note> 
               <hi>O thou poore one, affiicted and toſſed with tempeſtes, that haſt no comfort, behold I will receaue thee:</hi> and the which in an other place, after ſhe hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plained that the plowers haue plowed theyr backe, and the wicked haue made long forrowes as it were in a field, yet doth ſhe glory ſtraightwayes that their cordes
<pb facs="tcp:7787:8"/> were cut by the iuſt God, that they could not preuaile. And the Prophet hath not onely encouraged vs by the examples of thoſe tymes to hope and to patience, but he hath ioyned an exhortation taught by the holy ſpirite, which is extended to the whole kyngdome of Chriſt, and is peculiar vnto vs.</p>
            <p>Wherfore let it not be greuous vnto vs to be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded amongeſt the number of them, who as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſayth: <hi>Muſt be tryed by fyre that they may be made white:</hi> ſeyng that the ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable felicity and glory which ſpringeth therof, doth more then ſufficiently recompence all the griefes of the croſſe. And though many can feele no taſte in this doctrine, but thinke it vnſauery, yet may not their dulnes or ſluggiſhnes make vs the more ſlouthfull: and therfore muſt we print deepely in our hartes that which the Prophet ſtraight way pronounceth: that the wicked ſhall do wickedly, becauſe they will vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand nothyng: but the children of God ſhall be endued with the knowledge of God, that they may kepe the right courſe of their godly vocation. And it is neceſſary to conſider the fountaine of that brutiſh blindnes, that the heauenly doctrine may be ſauery vnto vs. For there is none other cauſe why the moſt part doth deſpiſe Chriſt and his Goſpell, but for that they careleſly flatter them ſelues in ſinne, and are neither wakened with any feare, neither with the ſenſe of their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, neither with the terrour of Gods wrath, to deſire ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and feruently the redemption which onely doth deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs from the bottomles depth of eternall deſtruction: and in the meane tyme beyng ſnared with pleaſures and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther allurementes, or rather betwitched thereby, they are all together careles of the bleſſed eternity of the other lyfe. And though there be many and ſondry ſectes of them that contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pteouſly deſpiſe the doctrine of the Goſpell, and in ſome of them pride is more euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, in ſome others tender weakenes, in others a certaine dronkennes of the mynde, in others a ſleapy dulnes: yet ſhall we finde that this contempt commeth of a prophane careles ſecurity: becauſe that no man doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into him ſelfe, to examine his owne miſeries to finde a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for them.</p>
            <p>This is a monſtrous madnes, when Gods wrath and curſe lyeth vpon vs, and his iuſt vengeance doth preſſe vs, that we ſhould caſt of all care, and ſtand in our owne conceit, as though nothyng were to be feared. How be it this vice is to much commune: that thoſe that are gilty a thouſand tymes and are worthy a thouſand tymes of eternall death, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
<pb facs="tcp:7787:9"/> haue ſleighty done a few fooliſhe ceremonies vnto God, they bryng them ſelues into a ſlepe, or rather a deadly and ſenſeles traunce. But ſeyng that <hi>Paul</hi> doth pronounce that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpell is deadly vnto all thoſe whoſe myndes the deuill bewitcheth: it is neceſſary for vs that will taſte the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour therof vnto lyfe, to ſet our ſelues before Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat, and often thether to ſommon our conſciences, the which beyng wounded with an vnfeined feare, the reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation which Chriſt hath purchaſed for vs with his bloud ſo precious, may be eſtemed of vs accordyng to the price and worthynes. Wherfore the aungell preacheth of the eternall iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice which Chriſt hath ſealed with the ſacrifice of his death, to cauſe men to reuerence Chriſtes doctrine, &amp; to wynne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie vnto it: and he expreſſeth alſo the maner and meane to obteine iuſtice: becauſe (ſayth he) iniquity is done away and purged. Therfore whiles the world doth run mad after theyr luſtes and wantonnes let the conſideration of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which we haue deſerued make vs afrayde and hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble vs before God. And whiles carnall men do glutte them ſelues with earthly pleaſures &amp; delites, let vs embrace with feruent deſire, this vncomparable treaſure, in the which an aſſured fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity and bleſſednes is layd vp for vs. Let our enemies prate as they pleaſe, that they alſo care how to haue God mercifull vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſeing they are of this opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that men muſt doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully call vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God in prayer, it is plaine that they ouerthrow the chief foundation of our ſaluation. Let them taunt &amp; ſcoffe at our fayth as long as they liſt, ſo that we feele aſſuredly that no man can attaine to this prerogatiue but by the benefite of fayth, with a free and quiet conſcience, truſtyng to the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, to call God father.</p>
            <p>But the ſtudy of Religion and care of godlines will neuer take force in vs as it ought to do, vntil we do learne to lift vp our myndes (which are alwayes ouer prone to the earth) and exerciſe them in a continuall meditation of the heauenly lyfe. In the which point the meruelous vanity of mankynd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayeth it ſelfe, that whereas al men can ſpeake plauſibly, as they were Philoſophers, of the ſhortnes of this life, yet no man aſpireth to that eternall and euerlaſtyng life.

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere foloweth the boke of <hi>Daniel</hi> the Prophet, the vtility &amp; commoditie wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, how great it is, may more eaſily bee vnderſtand by the goyng forward in the ſame, then aptly in fewe wordes be declared. But I will now giue ſome taſt yet therof, which may the better prepare vs to the readyng, &amp; make vs more attentiue. And before I do come ſo farre, I will briefly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the ſumme of the boke and ſo diuide it as may beſt further vs. Wherfore we will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide it into two partes. Firſt <hi>Daniel</hi> rehearſeth how he attei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned authoritie euen amongeſt the infidels. For it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie that he ſhould be rayſed vp to his propheticall office af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſtraunge &amp; rare maner. All thinges (as is well knowne) were ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſed and ſo farre out of order amongeſt the <hi>Iewes,</hi> that ſcarcely could any man beleue that there remained yet any Prophet. <hi>Hieremias</hi> was a lyue in the begynnyng, and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> afterward. Alſo the <hi>Iewes</hi> had their Prophetes after their returne: but <hi>Hieremias</hi> &amp; <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had almoſt ended their courſe when <hi>Daniel</hi> began to Prophecy. Others, as <hi>Haggaei, Zakari,</hi> and <hi>Malachi</hi> were created Prophets to exhort the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: ſo that their office ſeemed to be limited. As concernyng <hi>Daniel,</hi> he could ſcarcely be counted for a Prophet vnles God had ſet hym vp after a maruelous maner, as I haue ſayd.
<pb facs="tcp:7787:10"/> This ſhall we ſee to the end of the vj. chapter, that he was adourned of God with ſpeciall notes and tokens, that the <hi>Iewes</hi> might fully be aſſured y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God had geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hym vnto them for a Prophet, vnles they would condemne them ſelues of filthy ingratitude agaynſt God. His name was famous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt the <hi>Babilonians,</hi> and much honored. If the <hi>Iewes</hi> had deſpiſed hym that was had in admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the prophane Gentiles, was not this as it were of ſet purpoſe to quench &amp; to tread vnder foote the grace of God? <hi>Daniel</hi> therfore had certaine notes and tokens wherby he might be knowen the Prophet of God, &amp; wherby his vocation might be ratified.</p>
            <p>The ſecond part is ioyned afterward, wherby God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warneth by him what ſoeuer ſhould ſhortly come to the elect people. The viſions therfore from the vij. chapter to the end of the booke do peculiarly belong to the Church of God. For there God declareth what is to come: which was a thyng very neceſſary. It was a ſore tentation when the <hi>Iewes</hi> muſt ſuffer captiuitie 70. yeares, and yet after that they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into their countrey, for thoſe 70. yeares God did differre the full deliuerance vnto 70. times ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yeares. Their mindes might haue fayled and they all haue diſpayred a thouſand tymes. For the Prophetes had ſpoken ſo gloriouſly of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, that the <hi>Iewes</hi> did hope for an happy and moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſtate ſo ſoone as they ſhould be deliuered from the Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonicall bondage. But when they are oppreſſed agayne with ſo many afflictions, and that not for a ſhort tyme, but aboue foure hundreth yeares, where as they were in captiuitie but 70. yeares, the deliuerance might ſeme but a mockery. And there is no doubt but that Sathan dyd tempt the myndes of many to fall away from God, as though God had deluded them when he brought them forth of <hi>Chaldea</hi> into their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. For theſe cauſes God declared by a viſion vnto hys ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt, how many and how great afflictions did remaine for the people of God. Howbeit <hi>Daniel</hi> doth ſo Prophetie, that he doth almoſt lyke an Hiſtoriographer deſcribe all thoſe thyngs which then were ſecrete. And this was very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, becauſe that in ſo troubleſome alterations the people had neuer taſted that theſe thynges were reueled vnto <hi>Daniel</hi> by God if the ſucceſſe had not approued the heauenly teſtimonie. Therfore was it mete that this holy man ſhould thus ſpeake and Prophecie of thynges to come, as though he had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thynges already performed. But this ſhall we ſpeake of in place.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7787:11"/>
            <p>I returne to the begynnyng, to declare how profitable this booke of <hi>Daniel</hi> is to the Church of Chriſt. And firſt the matter it ſelfe declareth that <hi>Daniel</hi> did not ſpeake of his own head, but that what ſoeuer he did ſpeake it was taught hym by the holy ghoſt. For how could he haue coniectured theſe thynges that we ſhall ſee afterward, if he had folowed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng but ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s wiſedome: that is to ſay, that other Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies ſhould grow vp which ſhould deſtroy the Empire of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which had the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the greateſt power in all the world? Agayne, how could he coniecture of the commyng of great <hi>Alexander</hi> and of his ſucceſſors? Long before <hi>Alexander</hi> was borne <hi>Daniel</hi> dyd Prophecie what he ſhould do. Alſo he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth that his kingdome ſhould not be lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g becauſe it ſhould ſtraight wayes be diuided into foure hornes. Other thynges that he ſpeaketh alſo do manifeſtly proue that he ſpake by the holy Ghoſt. Howbeit this may be more euidently proued by his other Prophecies, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he admoniſheth with what great miſeries the Church ſhall be vexed betwixt thoſe two moſt cruell enemies y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng of <hi>Syria</hi> and the kyng of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> There doth he rehearſe their leagues, and then reciteth theyr cruell warres one agaynſt an other, and afterward all the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and he doth ſo point out euery thyng with the finger and proſecute the whole matter, that it may appeare that God ſpeaketh by his mouth. This is then a great thyng and very profitable, to know aſſuredly that <hi>Daniel</hi> was the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the holy Ghoſt, and that he dyd ſpeake nothyng of his owne brayne. Now that he was in ſuch authoritie to the end that he might be in more credite with the <hi>Iewes</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng his doctrine, that is extended vnto vs. For how foule and ſhamefull ingratitude is this, if we do not embrace the Prophet of God, whom the <hi>Chaldees</hi> were compelled to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: whom we know both to haue bene ſuperſtitious and full of pompe and pride? Thoſe two nations of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and <hi>Chaldees</hi> ſtode moſt in their owne conceit of all others. For the <hi>Chaldees</hi> thought that they onely had the Vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of all wiſedome. Wherfore they would neuer haue bene very ready to receiue <hi>Daniel,</hi> vnles the truth had compelled them, and that this confeſſion had bene violently wraſted forth of them, that <hi>Daniel</hi> was the very Prophet of God.</p>
            <p>Now when the authoritie of <hi>Daniel</hi> is thus confirmed, ſomethyng muſt be ſpoken of the matters that he treateth. And concernyng interpretations of dreames, the firſt dreame of <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> doth conteine (as we ſhall ſee) a thyng of
<pb facs="tcp:7787:11"/> moſt great importance, that is to ſay, that all the glory &amp; the power of the world muſt vaniſh away, and that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdome of Chriſt onely ſhall remaine ſtable, and that there is none other perpetuitie. As concernyng the ſecond dreame of <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezar,</hi> therin doubtles the meruelous conſtancy of <hi>Daniel</hi> is euident. It was a thyng very daungerous ſo to caſt down the Emperour of the whole world as <hi>Daniel</hi> did. Thou (ſayth he) wilt not be counted amongeſt men, but art now worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped as it were a God, thou ſhalt hereafter be a beaſt. There is no man at this day that dare thus ſpeake to Emperours and Kynges, either yet that dare admoniſh them gently whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they treſpas. Seyng then that <hi>Daniel</hi> did forwarne the kyng boldly what great ſhame he ſhould come vnto, doubtles herein he did declare a rare and notable example of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy. And thus was his vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſealed vp and more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed: for this boldnes came of the ſpirite of God. But we muſt rather ſtand of the ſecond parte, where we ſee Gods care towardes his Church. The prouidence of God vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly is ſpread throughout the world.<note place="margin">Mat. 10. Luk. 12.</note> For if a ſparow do not fall vpon the earth without his permiſſion, we may be ſure that he prouideth for mankind. Therfore nothyng commeth vnto vs by chaunce. But God in this booke doth ſet vs vp a light to ſee that the Church is ſo gouerned of him, that he hath a ſingular care ouer it. If euer thinges were ſo troubled and out of order in the world that men might coniecture that God dyd ſlepe in the heauens and forgate mankind, no doubt ſuch was the rollyng whele of thoſe tymes, yea there were ſo manifold and ſtraunge alterations, that he which was of the moſt hye courage might well faint, ſeing there was none end of warres, and ſometymes the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> gate the victorie, and ſometymes there were other ſtyrres and warres in <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi> Seyng then that all thynges were turned vpſide downe, what could be iudged, but that God contemned the world, and that the miſerable <hi>Iewes</hi> were deceiued of their hope when they thought that GOD which was their deliuerer would likewyſe be their keper and Sauiour at all tymes. For although all nations generally were then ſubiect to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny calamities, if yet the <hi>Syrians</hi> ouercame the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> then dyd they abuſe their power agaynſt the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was ſayd open to the ſpoyle, as though it had bene the wages of the victory. If other had ouercome in battaile, they aduenged their iniuries vpon the poore <hi>Iewes,</hi> and there they ſought their recompenſe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7787:12"/>
            <p>Thus were thoſe miſerable men ſpoyled, that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was much worſe after their captiuitie when they were returned into their countrey, then if they had alway bene exiles and ſtraungers in other countreys. And when they were admoniſhed of thinges to come, this was their chief ſtay wherupon to reſt. But the vſe of the ſame doctrine muſt be applied vnto vs at this day. For we do ſee as it were in a glaſſe or lyuely image, that God was carefull of his Church euen then when he ſemed to haue caſt of all care therof. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, that it was not without his diuine counſaile that the <hi>Iewes</hi> were thus expoſed to the iniuries of their enemyes. But of the other part we do acknowledge that they were meruailouſly perſerued euen with a greater and more mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous power of God, then if they had liued quietly and none had moleſted them. Theſe things are to be learned from the vij. Chapter to the ix. Now when <hi>Daniel</hi> doth nomber the yeares vntill the commyng of Chriſt, how cleare and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent a teſtimony is this, which we may ſet agaynſt Sathan and all the ſcoffes of the wicked: ſeyng it is certaine that the booke of <hi>Daniel</hi> was in mens handes before this came to paſſe. Where he the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reckeneth 70. Weekes, and affirmeth that then Chriſt ſhall come, let all prophane perſones come now and prate, and with open mouthes declare their obſtinacy: yet ſhall they be ouerthrowen in the end, and be conuinced that Chriſt is that true redemer whom God had promiſed from the begynnyng of the world: becauſe he would haue him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt with ſo ſure a demonſtration as no Aſtrologians haue the lyke.</p>
            <p>This then is well worthy to be obſerued and marked, that after that <hi>Daniel</hi> hath treated of diuerſe calamities of the Church, he appointeth the tyme wherin God would reuele his Sonne vnto the world: and that he treateth of the office of Chriſt. This is one of the chief Articles of our fayth. And he doth not onely ſpeake of his commyng, but Prophecieth that the ſhadowes of the law ſhall then be aboliſhed, becauſe that Chriſt will bryng the accompliſhment therof with him. And where he ſpeaketh of the death of Chriſt, he alſo teacheth to what end he ſhall ſuffer death, euen that he may aboliſhe ſinne by his ſacrifice, and may geue eternall iuſtice. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, this is to be noted, that euen as he had inſtructed hys auncient people to patient ſufferyng of afflictions, ſo doth he alſo admoniſh, that the ſtate of the Church ſhall not be quyet when Chriſt ſhall be geuen vnto the world: but that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb facs="tcp:7787:12"/> of God muſt haue a continuall battaile vnto the end, and that the fruition of the victory is not to be hoped for, whiles that the dead ſhall ariſe and Chriſt ſhall gather vs into his heauenly kyngdome. Thus do we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend briefly, or rather do taſt, how profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fruitfull this booke is. Now come I to the wordes, how that <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezar,</hi> either the father or the ſonne (for they both reigned together) came in the thyrd yeare of <hi>Iehoiakim,</hi> and tooke away <hi>Daniel</hi> and the firſt captiues, of whom <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth:<note place="margin">Ierem. 24 Ierem. 25.</note> afterward <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the fourth yeare and was worſe handled.</p>

Howbeit God preſerued <hi>Daniel</hi> and hys felowes with his ſpirite from this deuiliſh craft, that they abſteyne from the kynges meate and drinke, leſt they ſhould be polluted.

Therfore dyd he chuſe rather pulſe and moſt baſe dyet, not that he thought it vnlawfull for him and hys felowes to eate of the kynges meate &amp; to drinke wyne: but he dyd ſée what a hard thyng it is to kepe a meaſure in full tables and dayntie fare, and how ſoone we are decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued when we are enterteyned and fed delicately.

                     <p>Where it is written that God gaue <hi>Daniel</hi> fauour with the chief Eunuch, we muſt conſider the goodnes of GOD toward hys ſeruauntes, how he turneth the cruell hartes vnto mercy and pitie: that we may be the more bold to go forward with Gods buſines thorow all daungers. For this may many tymes come to paſſe, that we can not do the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice wherunto God hath called vs, without preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t daunger of lyfe (as that he ſhould accompt the kynges meat a pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was but a captiue and a priſoner, could not be without great dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, as appeareth by the Eunuches aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere) and becauſe we would flye ſuch dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, we waxe cowardes and ſluggiſh many tymes. <hi>Daniel</hi> therfore to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage vs in Gods matters, declareth that God gaue hym fauour with this Eunuch, to teach vs to caſt our care vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon God when any worldly terrour or manaces of men would terrifie vs from the folowyng of Gods ſpirite. And here we perceyue that it is in Gods hand to turne theyr hearts which rage agaynſt vs, ſo that he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deliuer vs from all perill when he pleaſeth.</p>
                     <p>Thus God cauſed the kyng which might haue vſed hym as a ſlaue, to commaunde hym to be vſed as a Princes child, and hys gouernour alſo to be very fauorable vnto hym. Wherby we gather this generall doctrine, that mens hearts are gouerned by God, ſo that hee can mollifie all fearcenes and cruelty, and make wolues lyke lambes ſo oft as it lyketh hys good pleaſure. As for example, when hys people came forth of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> God gaue them ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> deliuered vnto them all theyr chief iewels and ornamentes. Now it is playne that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> hated them neuertheles. What cauſeth them then to bryng foorth to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> all theyr pretious
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7787:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> iewels? Onely the Lord God of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who euen then put into theyr hartes new affections. And ſo of the contrary muſt we knew, that it is in Gods hand to make our deareſt frendes our greateſt enemies. Wherfore we muſt ſeeke God in all thynges. Truth it is that GOD frameth &amp; formeth ſome from their byrth to be either milde or cruell, but he doth not this onely for once, but dayly and continually when it ſo pleaſeth hym. Lyke as alſo he lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the myndes or blyndeth them euery houre and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at his pleaſure, ſo that the moſt wiſe ſhall ſometime ſée nothyng, where the moſt ſimple ſhall finde great comforte. Wherfore we may learne that mens hartes and myndes are ſo gouerned by Gods ſecret inſpiration, that he chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them at hys good pleaſure: and therfore that we nede not much to feare our enemyes, who though they rage ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo much, may yet be turned toward vs. And ſo by the example of <hi>Daniel</hi> let vs learne conſtantly to go forward in our courſe appointed, and not to turne backe though all the world be agaynſt vs: for God is able eaſily to remoue all impedimentes.</p>
                     <p>And this may we ſée by Gods mercy, that God cauſeth our enemyes to thinke well of vs in thoſe thynges which yet they do not allow in them ſelues. For he thought well of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that hee dyd well to worſhyp hys God after the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> maner, but he thought his <hi>Babilonicall</hi> Religion to be the beſt. As many prophane men now a dayes are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to graunt that we do well which caſt away Popiſh ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, yet do they ſléepe ſtill in this errour, that they may lyue ſtill after their old cuſtomes becauſe they were ſo brought vp and ſo taught by their forefathers. So doth this Eunuch make his excuſe by the kyng, and findeth no fault with <hi>Daniel.</hi> Yet doth <hi>Daniel</hi> with a ſingular conſtancy go forward with hys purpoſe and proueth the Eunuches ſeruaunt. And hereby we may learne to go forward with good things and know that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of a kyng in externall matters, can not binde our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces. And this is a true triall of our fayth, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are not wearied in ſéekyng
<pb facs="tcp:7787:18"/> to do well, neither ſteppe backe for a litle trouble, or thinke that the doore which is ſhut can not be opened. Wherfore if we do not turne backe from our good purpoſe, but proue all other meanes conuenient, then is it euident that godlynes hath taken ſome roote in our hartes. Wherfore he biddeth the ſeruaunt proue if God do not preſerue hym and hys fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes as well lykyng as others. And hereby we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that <hi>Daniel</hi> was moued by Gods ſpirite to require this ſo earneſtly, ſeing that God dyd as it were miraculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſerue them.</p>

                     <p>2 Then the king commaunded to call the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters, and the Aſtrologians, and the Sorſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and the Chaldeans for to ſhew the king his dreames. So they came &amp; ſtode before the king. </p>

                     <p>4 Then ſpake the Chaldeans to the king in the Sirians language: O king liue for euer. Shew thy ſeruaunts thy dreame, and we ſhall ſhew the interpretation.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Here Daniell ſaith that Nebuchadnezer had this dreame the ſecond yeare of his Empire, it ſemeth ſomthing contrary to the firſt Chapiter. For if Nebuchadnezer did conquer Ieruſalem the firſt yeare of his kingdome, how can it be that <hi>Daniell</hi> was now counted amonges the wyſe men and Aſtrologians, for he was then a Scholer? This ſeemeth not then to agree, that <hi>Daniell</hi> with his companions were but Scholers the firſt yeare of <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> and that the ſecond yeare he was in daunger of hys lyfe becauſe he was of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Mages. Some ſay that the ſecond yeare is to be
<pb facs="tcp:7787:20"/> counted from the captiuity and deſtruction of the Citie: for they ſay that <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> was called kyng after that he had a quiet Monarchy, and before he had deſtroyed the Temple and Citie he had not ſo. But I do thinke other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, as it is more probable, that this <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> raygned wyth hys father when he conquered Ieruſalem in the tyme <hi>Ioachim,</hi> and that he was then ſent thether by hys father: and after he had ended hys warres in <hi>Aegipt,</hi> he returned into <hi>Chaldea,</hi> to preuent ſeditions and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations. Wherefore herein there is no abſurdity, that <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> raigned before the death of hys father to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether wyth hym, and afterward he raigned alone: and that this thyng which is here ſpoken, came to paſſe in the ſecond yeare of his owne raigne. He ſayth that he dreamed dreames, and yet there is but one dreame declared. But becauſe many thynges were wrapped vp in thys dreame, he ſpeaketh plurally as of many.</p>
                     <p>It is added that his ſpirit was troubled, that we may know that it was no common dreame. For this was not the firſt tyme that euer he dreamed, neither was he ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled euery night to call together all the Mages. Wherefore <hi>Daniell</hi> woulde note that thys was an extraordinary dreame, ſo that he beyng aſtoniſhed did fall agayne into a dreame, &amp; through the trouble of his mynde, forgat what he had dreamed. But he felt a burning in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience becauſe God would not ſuffer hym to reſt, but would haue hys mynde to be vnquiet whiles that he ſhould haue the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the dreame. Wherefore the prophane writers do not without cauſe place dreames amonges diuinations. They ſpeake in déede doubtfully of dreames, becauſe there can be no certainty in their writinges: yet did they thinke that there was ſome kinde of diuination in their dreames. How be it to extend this to all dreames were fooliſhe and childiſh. For many tymes dreames do come of the affection of the mynde, or of the diſpoſition of the body: but of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary part, ſome dreames do come by Gods appointment for other purpoſes.</p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:7787:20"/>
                     <p>But concerning the dreame of <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> two thynges are to be noted: Firſt that the memory therof was loſt and it was forgotten: ſecondly that the meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was vnknowen. We may ſée in other places that the dreame was not forgotten, and yet that the interpretation was vnknowen. But here <hi>Nabuchadnezer</hi> was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubled for want of interpretation of the dreame, but he was troubled agayne and was full of care and griefe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the viſion was vaniſhed forth of hys mynde. As for the darknes of the dreames, God vſeth them ſo towardes his owne children. For <hi>Ioſeph</hi> when he dreamed that he was worſhipped of the Sunne and the Moone,<note place="margin">Gen. 37.</note> knew not what the matter ment: neither yet when he dreamed that his ſheafe was worſhipped of the ſheaues of his brethren, but he tolde it ſimply to his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thus doth God ſpeake in dreames as it were by a darke ridle, vntill the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation be annexed: and ſo was the dreame of <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus ſometimes we ſée y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God doth open his wil to the vnbeleuers, but not openly,<note place="margin">Iſa. 29.</note> becauſe they ſeyng ſhould not ſée: and it is as if one ſhould reach vnto them a booke that were ſhut (as <hi>Iſay</hi> ſayth) that God doth ſpeake with the vnbeleuers in a ſtraunge and a ſtamering toung.<note place="margin">Iſa. 28.</note> So then was Gods will vttered to <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> that he did ſtill remaine doubtfull and amazed: wherefore hys dreame could nothing haue profited hym, vnleſſe God had geuen hym <hi>Daniell</hi> to be the interpreter thereof. All hys cunning Aſtrologians and <hi>Chaldees</hi> could do nothing: as all theyr ſciences are vayne and fooliſh. The <hi>Chaldeans</hi> who had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to them the name of the Countrey as men moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, could tell the king nothing at all. <hi>Daniell</hi> and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes in the meane tyme are forgotten of the king, though he had good proofe of their wiſdome before (no doubt) by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſingular prouidence of God: becauſe God would not haue his ſeruauntes to be ioyned or coupled wyth the Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Sorcerers, and Mages, but would haue his power to be made euident in <hi>Daniell,</hi> after that all their vayne
<pb facs="tcp:7787:21"/> ſciences had fayled, and that the kyng by them could haue no comfort, though they boaſted much of their owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. But it is to be noted that the dreames that God ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth can not be expounded by any arte of man, but by ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reuelation from the almighty God.</p>

So that what wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or power ſo euer appeareth in any creature in the world, it is but a ſigne, teſtimony and declaration of Gods wiſedome and power, that God may be magnified. So that the change and alteration of times, of ſtates, of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and of all artes and ſciences, are but as it were glaſſes to cauſe man to beholde Gods power and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, by the which all thinges are gouerned.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:7787:24"/> his maieſtie in all thinges. If all the yeares and dayes ſhould runne after one courſe, we would attribute it vnto nature. But now when we ſée how farre ſommer doth differ from the winter, and that we haue not yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the like ſommer and the like winter: no ſometimes the ſpring time is hoote as the ſommer, ſometime it is as cold, as ſtormy, and ſnowye as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> winter, and the ſommers are ſometimes ſo ſtraunge and the yeares ſo diuerſe one from an other: all theſe alterations and changes are wrought by the wiſdome of God to waken vs, and to ſtirre our dull hartes to looke vp to the maker of all, and not to ſticke to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fond imagination of nature, as do the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and ſo robbe God of his honor.

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we learne to geue God his due prayſe in all thinges, which the world with open ſacrilege doth vſe to robbe from him: that if we haue any vnderſtanding or iudgement at all, we muſt knowledge it to be Gods gift. If we haue but one drop of common ſenſe or wit, we muſt prayſe God for it.

But aboue all, the knowledge of ſpirituall thinges is the rare and ſingular

Let vs therfore beware of that deueliſh pride wherewith the word is bewitched, boaſting in their giftes as though they came of them ſelues: &amp; let vs prayſe God for that he hath not only geuen vs the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune gift of wit and vnderſtandyng to put a difference betwixt good and euill, which ſéemeth only naturall: but that he hath ſo lightned our mindes, that we do perceiue thoſe ſpirituall thinges which els ſhould farre paſſe our capacities, and let vs pray continually that he would vouchſafe more and more to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to vs that light wherein he dwelleth, that ſo we may féele the power of his ſpirite working in our darkenes, and ſtrengthening vs in his ſeruice.</p>

As for the <hi>Romanes</hi> we knew how proudly they deſpiſed the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and though they had <hi>Pantheon</hi> wherin they worſhipped all the Idols and Gods of all the nations that they Conquered, yet would they not geue any honor or place to hym at all.</p>
                     <p>Agayne, how they hated Chriſtes Goſpell, how cruelly they murthered the Chriſtians, and labored by all meanes to diffame and baniſh forth of the world the doctrine of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, the matter is moſt manifeſt. Therfore <hi>Daniel</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh the faithful what ſhould be their condition and ſtate to the comming of Chriſt, doth pronounce all thoſe Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies and kyngdomes to be ſo many enemyes to God and to the kyngdome of his ſonne Chriſt, and that therfore they muſt be deſtroyed. And hereby he doth exhorte to patience, that the faithfull do not faint in ſo great miſeries and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions as the proude tyrauntes ſhould ſtyrre vp agaynſt them ſo oft and many tymes. And <hi>Daniel</hi> ſayth that this ſtone is hewen forth of the mountaine without handes, to ſignifie his diuine byrth &amp; ſending fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the heauens, ſo that his dominion &amp; kyngdome muſt be ſeparate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all earthly Empyre, becauſe it is immediatly from God and heauenly.</p>

The which comfortable promiſe of this eternall kingdome, doth not onely pertaine to the perſon of Chriſt, who is the onely king that liueth and raigneth for euer, but alſo to hys Church, which is the whole body of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to all his people and ſubiectes, and to euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar member and perſon of the ſame. Thus doth this eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall king communicate his eternitie to all his, becauſe he will haue alwayes a kyngdome in this world, though the world can not alwayes ſée it, and he doth regenerate al his true ſubiectes of thys kingdome w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his eternall ſpirite into euerlaſtyng lyfe, to raygne wyth hym in hys kingdome for euer.

Secondly in euery one of the faythfull there is an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perpetuity, becauſe they are borne agayne by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible ſéede, and beyng borne by the ſpirit of God, are not onely the mortall children of <hi>Adam,</hi> but they cary the heauenly lyfe in themſelues, becauſe the ſpirit which is in them is life, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth to the <hi>Romaynes.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>And we ſée how thys kingdome hath bene eternall euer ſince the doctrine of the Goſpell hath bene preached. For though the Church haue ſéemed ſometymes as it had bene buried, yet God gaue life in the very graue of Idolatry and ignoraunce vnto hys elect. And now how is it come to paſſe that the children of the Church &amp; the ſouldiours of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes kingdome are come forth as it were of the graue in ſuch aboundaunce, but that the Lord hath mercy vpon Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on becauſe hys tyme appointed is come,<note place="margin">Pſal. 102.13</note> and therefore his ſeruauntes delite to builde vp Zion, yea he himſelfe wyll builde it, and his glory ſhall appeare, and the heathen ſhall feare and all the kinges of the earth at his glory, and the people which ſhall be as it were new created, ſhall prayſe the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, <hi>Daniel</hi> ſayth that this kingdome can not be tranſlated from one to an other, as the firſt was from <hi>Baltazar</hi> to <hi>Darius,</hi> the ſecond from <hi>Darius</hi> to <hi>Alexander,</hi> the thirde from that curſed kinred of <hi>Alexander</hi> and hys Princes to the <hi>Romaines.</hi> The fourth of the <hi>Romaynes</hi> was turned not onely to ſtraungers of forraine nations, but to ſwineherds (as <hi>Iuſtine</hi> writeth), to beaſtes, as was <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> to monſters in nature, as was <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Caligula,</hi> and ſuch lyke: like as alſo, as the Goſpell did grow it continually decayed becauſe it was ſo manifeſt an enemy to Chriſtes kingdome. But as for Chriſtes king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, neither can Chriſt be ſpoiled of his power and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, neither yet we his members can loſe this kingdome, whereof hee hath made vs pertakers. Therefore Chriſt raigneth for euer, as well in hym ſelfe as in hys members, without any perill of alteration: for we ſhall be preſerued for euer by hys grace, and hee hath receaued vs into hys

                     <p>And thus would <hi>Daniel</hi> haue all men to ſée that there is no ſtabilitie any where, how great ſo euer the power or glory appeare, but onely in Chriſt.

Thus do many Princes when they publiſh lawes for Religion, rather regarde their owne quietnes and commoditie, then what God requireth by his word. And this bold temeritie hath bene amongeſt them from the begynnyng, that ſometymes they would make new Gods, ſometyme they would appoynt GOD a law how he ſhould be worſhypped: but they would rarely or neuer ſubiect them ſelues onely &amp; wholly to the word of God.

                        <hi>2</hi> Then Nebuchadnezer the king ſent forth to gather together the nobles, the princes, and the dukes, the iudges, the receiuers, the counſellers, the officers, and all the gouerners of the prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that they ſhould come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king had ſet vp.</p>

                     <p>

                        <hi>5</hi> That when ye heare the ſound of the cornet, trumpet, harpe, ſackebut, pſalteries, dulcimer, and all inſtrumentes of muſicke, ye fall downe and worſhip the golden image which Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nezer the king hath ſet vp.</p>

                     <p>Although their purpoſe is not heare expreſſed that accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Sadrach Meſach</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> yet of the end by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable coniecture we do gather that this was done of a ſet purpoſe when the kyng ſet vp the golden Image. For we do ſée how they were obſerued and marked amongeſt ſo great a multitude. And (as was ſayd before) it ſemeth that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7787:33"/> 
                        <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> dyd folow the commune policie of kyngs. For though they preſumptuouſly deſpiſe God, yet do they arme them ſelues with Religion to eſtabliſh their power, and for this purpoſe onely do they diſſemble ſome kynde of Religion, to containe the people in obedience. Whereas then the <hi>Iewes</hi> were mixed with the <hi>Chaldees</hi> and <hi>Aſsiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> the kynges policie was to preuent all controuerſies, and therefore doth he ſet vp this Image in a famous place, that it might bee a proufe and a triall whether the <hi>Iewes</hi> would ioyne them ſelues to the rites of the <hi>Babilonians.</hi> And this place may miniſter ſome probable coniecture that the kyng was moued hereunto by his counſellers, becauſe they were not well content that ſtraunge men of an other nation ſhould be head officers of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who yet were but as ſlaues: for by the law of armes they were taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore ſeyng the <hi>Chaldees</hi> grudged at this, their malice &amp; enuy moued them to geue the kyng this counſell. For els how commeth it to paſſe that they ſo ſodainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that the <hi>Iewes,</hi> namely <hi>Sadrach, Meſach,</hi> and <hi>Abed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nego</hi> do no worſhip nor reuerence to the Image: Surely it appeareth that they dyd as it were lye in wayt to eſpy what the <hi>Iewes</hi> would do, and thereby may we gather that they imagined this crafty accuſation at the firſt when as they counſelled the kyng to make this Image. And that with cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor and tumult they do accuſe the <hi>Iewes,</hi> hereby do we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that their mindes were full of enuy and hatred. It might be ſayd, that they were ſtyrred with zele, as ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious men would haue all other bound to their madnes, as alſo cruelty foloweth ſuch fooliſh zele alwayes: but here it is euident that enuy onely caryed away the <hi>Chaldees</hi> with ſuch clamors to accuſe the <hi>Iewes.</hi> And it is vncertaine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſpeake of the whole nation, that is to ſay, of all the exiles generally, or of theſe thrée onely. This is probable and lykely, that they dyd reſtrayne their accuſation to theſe thrée. For if theſe thrée had bene brought down, they would eaſily haue conquered the reſt. For few would haue bene
<pb facs="tcp:7787:34"/> found ſo conſtant amongeſt all the people. It is very lyke therfore that theſe outrageous cryers do aſſayle thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they compted moſt bold &amp; conſtant: and ſo labour to bryng them down from that hygh dignitie, in the which they could not abide to behold them.</p>
                     <p>Here may it bee demaunded why they ſpared <hi>Daniel,</hi> when it is not lyke that hee would diſſemble any thyng at all when the kyng commaunded the Image to be worſhyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped which he had ſet vp. It may be that they abſteined fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Daniel</hi> for a tyme, whom they knew to be in the kynges fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour: &amp; that they dyd accuſe theſe thrée which might more eaſily and with leſſe labour be oppreſſed. I ſuppoſe that this craft moued them that they dyd not name <hi>Daniel</hi> together with theſe thrée, leſt peraduenture the fauour that he was in ſhould mitigate the kynges wrath. Now foloweth the forme of their accuſation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>O King, Liue thou for euer.</hi> That was their common ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation. It is added afterward: <hi>Thou O king,</hi> for vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, as though they ſhould ſay: thou of thy kyngly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty haſt made a decree, that who ſo euer ſhould heare the voyce of the Trumpet, Harpe, Pipe, and other inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of muſike, hee ſhould fall downe before the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Image, and who ſo euer refuſed thys, ſhould be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fornace of flaming fire. But here are Iewes whom thou haſt ſet ouer the charge of the prouince of <hi>Babylon.</hi> This they put to in deſpite, to charge them with ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that they being brought to ſo great honor by the king ſhould deſpiſe the kinges commaundement, and intice o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by theyr enſample to like diſobedience. We ſée ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that this was ſpoken to amplify the crime, that the king had ſet them ouer the prouince of <hi>Babylon,</hi> &amp; they did not worſhip the golden Image neither honor his Gods.</p>
                     <p>We ſée that the <hi>Chaldees</hi> in all this accuſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this reſpect, to condemne <hi>Shadrah, Meſhach,</hi> and <hi>Abed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nego</hi> of this crime onely, that they did not obey the kinges commaundemement. For they doo not diſpute of theyr re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, becauſe that was not profitable for them, to call into
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7787:34"/> queſtion whether the Gods that they worſhipped were worthy ſuch worſhip or no. Therefore they paſſe with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that thing which they thinke not to be expedient, and they lay faſt holde of this darte: that the kinges maieſty is contemned, becauſe theſe thrée do not worſhip the Image which the king by his decrée had commaunded.</p>
                     <p>Here agayne doo we ſée that ſuperſticious perſons doo not apply theyr minde nor care to ſearch out the true or right worſhip of God: but caſting of this care, they follow onely theyr fooliſhe boldenes and theyr owne luſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeing ſuch fooliſhe temeritie is ſet foorth vnto vs by the holy ghoſt, as it were in a glaſſe, let vs learne that our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and worſhipping of God can not be allowed by God, vnleſſe it be grounded of the worde of God: and that in this poynt therefore the authoritie of men is nothing to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. For except we be aſſured that the religion which we follow doth pleaſe God, what ſo euer by mans autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie can be brought to the confirmation thereof, it is weake and nothing woorthe.</p>
                     <p>Forthermore, ſeing we ſée theſe holy men charged with the crime of vnthankefulnes and alſo of rebellion, there is no cauſe why we ſhoulde thinke much to ſuffer the ſame at thys day. Thoſe that falſely accuſe vs, do lay rebellion to our charge, becauſe (forſooth) that we deſpiſe the decrées of princes which would binde vs to their errors and blindnes. But as we ſhall ſée afterwarde, we haue an eaſy and ready defence: yet muſt we ſuffer this reproch for a while before the worlde, as though we were ſtubburne and rebellious: And though the wicked do charge vs with ingratitude and a thouſand reproches moe, yet muſt we beare theyr ſclaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders paciently for a ſeaſon, whiles the Lord come with hys brightnes and glory to mayntayne our innocency.</p>

                  </q>
                  <div type="meditation">
                     <p>This hyſtory doth euidently declare vnto vs, that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in diſſembling ſome Religion haue onely regard to their owne authoritie, that they may the better thruſt in them ſelues into the place of the Gods. For this is a monſtrous matter, that kyng <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> doth here bragge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt all the Gods, as though there were no power in heauen, but that which he alloweth. What God (ſayth he) can deliuer you out of my hand? And why then dyd be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyp any other God? For this cauſe verely, to hold the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in with ſome bridle, and ſo to eſtabliſh his tyranny: not that he had any care of holynes in his hart. <hi>Daniel</hi> doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that the kyng was angry at the begynnyng. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng is more greuous to kynges then to ſée their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie deſpiſed. They wilbe obeyed in all thinges, though their commaundementes be moſt wicked.</p>
                     <p>Yet the kyng ſemeth afterward to temper hym ſelfe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he aſketh <hi>Sadrach, Meſach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> if they be not ready to worſhyp his God and that Image of gold. When therfore he ſpeaketh vnto them doubtfully and doth yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound vnto them frée choyce, there is ſome moderation in theſe wordes. For it ſemeth that he will not charge them
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7787:35"/> with any crime, ſo that they will ſuffer them ſelues to bée turned afterward. But in the meane ſeaſon the rage brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth out vnder this deceaueable ſhew of moderation, for he addeth ſtraight wayes: <hi>Vnles ye obey, behold ye ſhalbe caſt into the fornace of burnyng fire:</hi> And at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> length he breaketh forth into that curſed ſacriledge and horrible blaſphemy, that there is no God which can deliuer thoſe holy men out of his handes.</p>
                     <p>We ſée therfore in the perſon of <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> with what pride Princes do ſwell and are puffed vp, euen where they pretend ſome zele of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe they are not tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with any true reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the true God, but will haue what ſoeuer they commaunde, to be receiued of all men: and ſo (as I haue ſayd) they do rather thruſt them ſelues into Gods place, then ſtudy to worſhip God a right or to maintayne his glory. To the ſame end tende the wordes which he vſeth ſaying, that he hath ſet vp the Image that he made. As though he ſhould ſay: it is not now lawfull for you to conſult whether the Image ought to be worſhypped or no, for my commaundement ought to be ſufficient vnto you. I haue ſet vp this Image, not without conſultatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and reaſon, therfore it were your duety ſimply to obey vnto me</p>
                     <p>We ſée therfore how he chalengeth moſt high authoritie euen in the makyng of a God. For he doth not here treate of politike matters, but he will haue this Image worſhyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped as God, becauſe he hath decréed ſo, becauſe he hath pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed his law. And we muſt alway remember (as I haue touched) that this example of pride is ſet forth before vs that we may know how we ought to attempt nothyng raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Religion, but that we muſt heare God ſpeake, ſo that we depend of his word and authoritie: for if we ſticke vnto men there wilbe no end of errours.</p>
                     <p>Although therfore that Princes be proude and ragyng, yet muſt we kéepe this rule, that nothyng pleaſeth God but that which he hath commaunded in his word, and that the begynnyng of true Religion is the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which we geue to God alone. As concernyng the blaſphemy, it doth declare
<pb facs="tcp:7787:36"/> that which I haue ſpoken more playnely, that is to ſay, how ſoeuer they pretend Religion, yet they deſpiſe all the power of God, and they haue none other thyng in their harts but to ſet forth their authoritie, and therfore they borow the name of God that they may be the more honored. Howbeit in the meane tyme if it were profitable to chaunge theyr Gods a hundreth tymes euery day, they would not care to do it.</p>
                     <p>Therfore is Religion for the moſt part but a pretence to earthly Princes, and no true reuerence of God is in their hartes, as in this prophane kyng is euident. For who is that God, ſayth he? He excepteth no God. If a man aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that he ſpeaketh by compariſon becauſe he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the glory of his God that he worſhypped: yet when hée belcheth forth this blaſphemy agaynſt all Gods, ſurely his arrogancy is intolerable, yea it was a deuiliſh fury which droue him ſo farre. Now let vs come to the chief point, where <hi>Daniel</hi> declareth with how great conſtancy <hi>Sadrach Meſach</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> were endued.</p>

                  <div type="meditation">
                     <p>This is the chief thyng to be conſidered in this hyſtory, that theſe three holy men dyd remaine conſtant in the feare of God, though they dyd know moſt preſent daunger of death to hang ouer their heades. Wherefore when death was ſet before their eyes, they turned not backe from their right courſe, but they ſet more by the glory of God, then
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7787:36"/> by their owne life, yea then by an hundreth lyues, if it had bene nedefull to haue beſtowed ſo many, and that had bene graunted vnto them. <hi>Daniel</hi> doth not rehearſe all their wordes, but gathereth a brief ſumme onely: in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which yet that inuincible power of the holy ghoſt wherewith they were indued, doth playnely appeare.</p>
                     <p>Surely this was an horrible threatnyng when the kyng ſayd: <hi>If ye be not ready to fall downe before the Image at the blast of the trumpet, ye ſhall the ſame houre bee caſt into the firy fornace.</hi> When the kyng thundered after this maner, they might be ſhaken as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For we know how deare life is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, &amp; how the feare of death ſmiteth all our ſenſes. But <hi>Daniel</hi> rehearſeth all theſe circumſtances, that we may know that there is more ſtrength in the ſeruauntes of God when they are led with his ſpirite, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they ſhould geue place to any threatninges, or fall downe for any terror.</p>
                     <p>They aunſwere the kyng that there nedeth no long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation. For in that they ſay that they are not carefull, they ſignifie by this word that the matter is determined: as that worthy ſaying of <hi>Cyprian</hi> is reported by <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Courtiours did counſell him that he ſhould regard hys lyfe (for the Emperour dyd agaynſt his will iudge hym to torment,) whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> flatterers dyd thus vrge him of euery ſide to ſaue his life by deniall of Religion, he au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwered: In a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that is holy or of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there nedeth no deliberation. So do theſe holy men ſay: <hi>We care not,</hi> that is, we neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into conſultation or deliberation what is expedient, what is profitable. No, this is already concluded, that we by no meanes will bee drawne from the pure worſhyp of God. If thou read it [we ought not to aunſwere thee] it will be almoſt the ſame ſenſe. For they declare that the feare of death is in vayne ſet before them: for they are vtterly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and their hartes ſettled, not to ſwarue one ſtraw bread from the true and lawfull worſhip of God.</p>
                     <p>And here they do vſe two reaſons to reiect that which the kyng propounded. They ſay that God hath power and ſtrength enough to deliuer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Agayne though they ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:7787:37" rendition="simple:additions"/> dye, yet that they do not ſo much eſteme lyfe that they will deny God to prolong it. Therfore they declare them ſelues to be ready to dye if the kyng will ſo rigorouſly vrge them to worſhyp the Image.</p>
                     <p>This place is worthy to be noted. For firſt this au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwere is to be learned, that when men are about to bryng vs to deny God, we muſt ſhut our eares, and take no farther ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſement. For euen then begyn we to do great iniury vnto God, when we diſpute whether we may decline from hys pure worſhip or no, what ſo euer cauſe may therunto moue vs. And would to God this were well knowne to all men, that the glory of God doth excell and ſurmount all thinges, that all muſt be brought law when the diminiſhyng or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuryng therof is intended.</p>
                     <p>But this craft beguileth many now a dayes, that they thinke it lawful to way, as it were in balance, whether it be better for a tyme to turne from the true worſhyp of God, when any profite doth offer it ſelfe of the other ſide: as we do ſée at this day ſuch diſſemblers, of whom the world is full, to haue their colours to cloke their wickednes, when either they worſhyp the Idoles with the wicked, or els they deny either priuely or openly the true Religion. O what is to be done, the man that is in any office will ſay? I ſée how much good I can do if I diſſemble a little and do not ſhew my ſelfe what I am: for this playnes would not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hurte me priuately but all others. If the kyng haue none that may ſometymes pacifie his anger, the wicked thereby ſhalbe vnbridled and haue their will and libertie to driue hym vnto all cruelty. It is better therfore that ſome kéepe a meane and ſo hearken and lye in wayte what the wicked do, and ſo though they can not do it openly, yet by ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret practiſes they may turne away the daunger from the heades of the godly.</p>
                     <p>When they obiect theſe Argumentes, they thinke that God is au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwered: As though <hi>Sadrach, Meſach,</hi> and <hi>Abed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nego</hi> could not haue prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the ſame, or as though it had not come into their mindes thus to ſay: behold we are now
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7787:37"/> armed with ſome authoritie to helpe our brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and what a barbarous crueltie will be executed amongeſt them, if the open enemyes of Religion come into our place: for, as much as lyeth in them, they will doſtroy and roote out of the earth our nation and all memory of true Religion? Is it not better then that we for a tyme gyue place vnto tyranny and to this cruell commaundement of the kyng, then to leaue our place deſtitute, which ſtraight wayes ſhall be occupyed with outrageous enemyes, who will vtterly ouercome our miſerable nation, which is to much oppreſſed already? I ſay, they might haue gathered all theſe clokes and colours to excuſe their infidelitie, if for the auoydyng of daunger they had knéeled before that golden Image: but they do not ſo. Therfore (as I haue already ſayd) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath God his due and true honor, when his worſhip is determined with out all doubtyng, and that we are fully perſuaded in this, that nothyng ought to be ſo deare vnto vs, that we may thinke it lawfull to ſwarue, though neuer ſo litle, from that profeſſion which hée commaundeth and requireth in hys word.</p>
                     <p>To be ſhort, here is that ſecuritie which ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the true worſhyppers of GOD, ſet agaynſt all the craftes and croked counſailes which they inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that do loſe the cauſe of lyfe for the loue of lyfe, as the Poet ſayth. For wherfore do we liue but to ſerue to the glory of God? This cauſe why we lyue, do we loſe for the loue of lyfe, when we beyng ouer carefull to lyue in the world, do not regarde the end of our lyfe. So then doth <hi>Daniel</hi> ſet forth the ſimplicity which the children of God muſt nedes folow, agaynſt all the ſubtill reaſons which the diſſemblers inuent, to couer their wickednes with ſome coulor. Therfore we are not carefull. Wherefore? Becauſe we know aſſuredly that the glory of God is more worth then a thouſand lyues, or what ſoeuer the ſenſe of the fleſh can miniſter vnto vs. Then where this magnanimitie ſhall take place, all doubtfull wranglyng ſhall vaniſh away, &amp; they which are called into daunger for the teſtimony of the truth, ſhal not weary them
<pb facs="tcp:7787:38"/> ſelues with vayne reaſons. For (as I haue ſaid) their eares ſhalbe ſhut vp agaynſt all theſe alurementes of Sathan.</p>
                     <p>And when they do adde: <hi>That God is able to ſaue them, and if he will not, yet that they are ready to dye,</hi> they declare what ſhould erect and lift vp our mindes aboue all temptations, euen that our lyfe is precious vnto God, and that he can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer vs if he will. Seyng then we haue ſuccour enough in God, let vs not thinke that there is any better way to ſaue our lyfe then to geue our ſelues wholly vnto his protection and defence and ſo caſt vpon hym all our cares.</p>
                     <p>Agayne, in the ſecond member this is to be noted, that if God will ſet forth hys glory by our death, this is a lawfull ſacrifice which we muſt offer vnto hym, and that true holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes can haue no force in vs vnles our lyues be in our hands, that is to ſay, except our lyues be alwayes prepared for ſacrifice.</p>

                        <hi>GRaunt almighty God, that wheras we ſee the wicked to be caryed with ſo great rage after their fond and filthy imaginations, and that they are ſo puffed vp with ſo great pride and arrogancy: that we may learne true humilitie and ſo ſubiect our ſelues vnto thee, that we may depend wholly of thy mouth, and that we enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe nothyng without thy warrant: And when we haue learned what worſhyp pleaſeth thee, that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly continue in the ſame vnto the end, and neither by any perils, neither by any threatnynges or cruelty to be moued away from our ſtabilitie, neither that we be led out of the way at any tyme: but perſeueryng in the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of thy word, thou mayeſt allow our endeuour and ſeruice and ſo knowledge vs for thy children, that we once may be gathered into that euerlaſting heritage which thou haſt prepared for all the members of thy ſonne Chriſt. So be it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We haue noted the conſtancy of <hi>Sadrach, Meſach,</hi> and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7787:38"/> 
                        <hi>Abednego</hi> grounded vppon theſe two reaſons, that they were ſurely perſuaded that GOD was the keper of theyr lyfe, and that they ſhould be deliuered by his power fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent death, if it were ſo profitable: Secondly, becauſe they had determined with them ſelues that they would dye bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and without feare, if God would haue ſuch a ſacrifice of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto hym. And that which <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaketh of theſe thrée men, perteineth vnto vs all. Therfore may we gather hereby a generall doctrine when daunger commeth vnto vs for the teſtimony of the truth, that we learne firſt to lay vp our lyfe in the hand of God: ſecondly that we be ready to dye boldly and without feare.</p>
                     <p>As concernyng the firſt, experience teacheth vs that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fayle from God and from the profeſſion of theyr fayth, becauſe they can not ſtand ſure in this point, that God is ſtrong enough to deliuer them. It is true that this is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of all men, that God hath a care ouer vs: Agayne, that our lyfe is in his hand: but ſcarcely the hundreth man hath this firmely and certainly faſtened in his hart: for euery one ſearcheth a way and meane to ſaue his lyfe, as though there were no power in God. Therefore he at the length hath rightly profited in the word of the Lord, which hath learned that his lyfe is cared for of GOD, and alſo that hée hath helpe and defence ſufficiently in him. For he that is gone thus farre, may ſafely enter into dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger an hundreth tymes, for he will not doubt to folow whether ſoeuer God calleth. For this one thyng doth deliuer hym from all feare and care, that God can take hys ſeruauntes out of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand deathes, as it is ſayd in this Pſalme:<note place="margin">Pſal. 68.23</note> 
                        <hi>In hys hand are the iſhues of death.</hi> For death ſemeth to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſume all things: but God deliuereth out of that deuouryng gulfe whom he pleaſeth. So this perſuaſion ſhall ſuffice vs to a ſtable and inuincible conſtancy.</p>
                     <p>But it is neceſſary that they which caſt their whole care of their lyfe and ſafety vpon God, haue a cleare conſcience, that they doubt nothyng but that they mayntaine a good cauſe. And this is alſo expreſſed in theſe wordes, when <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drach,
<pb facs="tcp:7787:39"/> Meſach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> do ſay: <hi>Behold our God who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we worſhyp.</hi> When they alledge the worſhyp of God, they te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie that they haue a ſure grounde, and that they do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng raſhly: that they are the worſhyppers of the true God, and that they labour for the defence of Religion. For this is the difference betwixt the Martyrs and mad men, which oft tymes are iuſtly puniſhed for their madnes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are about to peruert all thynges. For we ſée very many to be driuen with theyr owne rage, and if ſuch be put to death, they are not to be nombred amongeſt Gods Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs. For the cauſe maketh the Martyr, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, not the puniſhment. Wherefore there is no ſmall force in theſe wordes, when theſe thrée men do affirme that they worſhyp God: for by this they do glory that they do not raſhly enter into the daunger that ſtandeth before them, but for the true worſhyp of God.</p>
                     <p>Now come we to the ſecond. <hi>If God will not deliuer vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death, know thou O king, that we will not worſhyp thy Gods.</hi> I ſayd firſt of all, that our lyfe muſt be committed wholly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God before we can be prepared conſtantly to vndertake any great daunger, and that the deſire of this earthly and and tranſitory lyfe ought not to hynder nor hold vs from a frée and plaine profeſſion of the truth: for the glory of God ought to be more precious vnto vs then a hundreth lyues. Wherefore we can not be witneſſes of God, vnles we lay downe the deſire of this life, or at the leaſt preferre Gods glory before it. In the meane ſeaſon it is to be noted, that this can not be done except the hope of a better lyfe do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſh vs vnto it. For where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promiſe of the eternall inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce is not faſtened in our harts, we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer be drawne away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the world. For naturally we couet to be, and that affection can not be drawne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs except faith get the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, as Paul ſayth: <hi>We would not be vnclothed, but would be clothed vpon this mortalitie.</hi> Paul affirmeth that men natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally can not be brought willyngly to go out of the world, except (as is ſayd before) that fayth get the victory. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we vnderſtand that our inheritaunce is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauens &amp; that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7787:39"/> we are ſtraungers in the earth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do we put of the deſire of this earthly lyfe, whereunto we are to much addicted.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two are the thynges then which do prepare the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God vnto Martyrdome, that they doubt nothyng to offer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues and theyr lyues into the handes of God for a ſacrifice, that is to ſay: if they be perſuaded that theyr lyfe is preſerued of God, and that he wilbe an aſſured de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerer, if he ſée it to be expedient: Agayne when they clime vp aboue this world and aſpire vnto the hope of that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and euerlaſtyng lyfe, &amp; ſo be ready to forſake the world. And in their wordes a great magnanimitie may bée noted when they ſay: <hi>Be it knowen to thee, O king, that we worſhyp not thy Gods, neither the Image that thou hast erected:</hi> for here they accuſe the kyng after a ſorte, that he wilbe ſo arrogant to appoint Religion at his pleaſure. Thou haſt ſet vp an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, but thine authoritie is to vs of no valure, for we know that it is a fayned God whom thou wilt haue to bée worſhipped vnder this Image. But the God whom we worſhyp hath opened hym ſelfe vnto vs, and declared that he will not be worſhypped vnder any Image. We know that he is the maker of heauen and earth, and that he hath redemed our fathers forth of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> &amp; that he would cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten vs whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he caſt vs forth into this baniſhment.

                     <p>At the firſt ſight God ſéemeth here to forſake hys ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes becauſe he doth not openly helpe them. The kyng commaundeth them to be caſt into a fiery fornace: no helpe appeareth from the heauens. Wherfore this was a full and perfect triall of their fayth. They were now armed, as we did ſée before, to ſuffer all things. For they do not aunſwere ſo conſtantly onely becauſe they truſted in the preſent helpe of God: but becauſe they were determined to dye, and a better life dyd ſo comfort their mindes, that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to loſe this preſent lyfe.</p>
                     <p>This was the cauſe that they were not afrayde for the terrible co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of the king, but they followed theyr courſe, euen to ſuffer death without all feare for the honor of God. For there remayned no thyrd thing, but eyther to chuſe to dye, or els to deny the worſhip of the true God. By the which example we are taught to premeditate this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall life in our quiet ſtate, that if it ſo pleaſe God, we do not doubt to lay downe our liues for the teſtimony of the truth: for this is one cauſe why we are ſo fearefull. Agayne, when we doo come into preſent daunger, then doo we tremble and quake, becauſe whiles we are forth of danger we vaynely imagine to our ſelues a continuall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitiy. So long therefore as God geueth vs quietnes, we muſt apply our myndes to meditate the life to come, that the worlde may waxe vile vnto vs, and that we may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſo oft as néede ſhalbe, to geue our bloude for the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the truth. For this hiſtory is not ſet forth vnto vs, that we ſhould onely commend and magnify the vertue and conſtancy of theſe thrée holy men, but it is ſet forth for vs to imitate theyr conſtancy.</p>
                     <p>And concerning the king <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> here <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> agayne, as it were in a glaſſe, doth ſhew vnto vs the pride and arrogancy of kinges when theyr commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes are not obeyed. Surely a hart of yron ſhould haue bene mollified with this anſwere, that <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> did commit theyr liues vnto God, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not for feare of death be drawn from theyr fayth.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7787:40"/> But he is filled with anger. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning this rage we ought to conſider what power Sathan hath ouer me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath them in his clawes. They haue no moderation nor rule of themſelues, although at other times they make a fayre ſhew of vertue: As this king had many tokens of vertue, as we haue ſene before, but becauſe the deuill doth now ſtyr hym, there appeareth nothing in hym but crueltie and rage.</p>
                     <p>Forthermore, let vs remember that our conſtancy doth pleaſe God, although it doo not ſhew forth the fruite therof before the world. For many vnder this colour ſpare themſelues to liue in their pleaſures, becauſe they thinke it a raſhnes to offer themſelues to death when there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth no profit. And many excuſe themſelues vnder this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that they ſtriue no more for the glory of God, becauſe they ſhould loſe their labour, and theyr death ſhould be fruit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les. But we doo heare Chriſt pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce this to be a pleaſant ſacrifice vnto God,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.11.10.32. Mar. 8.38.</note> when we offer our liues for the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the heauenly doctrine, although the generation before whom we teſtify the name of God, be crooked &amp; adultrous, yea though it waxe the more ſtubbern at our conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy. And ſuch an example is here ſet forth vnto vs in theſe thrée holy perſons. For how ſo euer <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> waxed more &amp; more outragious with their bolde confeſſion, yet did that playne confeſſion pleaſe God, and they did not repent it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they did ſée no ſuch fruit of theyr conſtancy as they deſired. And the prophet doth expreſſe the circumſtance, to declare the kinges rage: that he commaundid the fornace to be made ſeuenfolde hoater then it was wont, and chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of his ſtrongeſt men to caſt theſe into the fornace. But as it appeareth by the ſucceſſe, all this was done by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret prouidence of God. For the deuill might els haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured the miracle, if all doubtes had not bene remoued. But when the king commaundeth the fornace to be made ſeuenfolde hoater, and did chuſe out his ſtrongeſt men to doo the execution, God by deliuering his ſeruauntes tooke away all doubtfulnes, that the more light ſhould ſhine forth of that darkenes which Sathan thought to haue blinded
<pb facs="tcp:7787:41"/> men withall, the kinges policy and his power.</p>
                     <p>Thus God vſeth to diſapoynt the wicked, and the more witty that they be to obſcure Gods glory, the more doth God cauſe both his glory and his doctrine to ſhyne forth: Like as here, as it were in an image, <hi>Daniel</hi> doth paynt vnto vs, that the king <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> left nothing vndone, whiles that he would thus ſmite a terror vnto all the Iewes with this cruell puniſhment: and yet atteyned he nothing with all his ſubtill fetches, but that the power of God and his fauour ſhould be more euidently opened to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes his ſeruaunte.</p>

                     <p>Here <hi>Daniel</hi> declareth the miracle whereby God deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered his ſeruauntes. Whereof there be two partes: One, that thoſe thrée men walked ſafe in the midſt of the fire: an other that the flame burnt vp the kinges Garde that caſt them into the fire. And the prophet doth diligently rehearſe the circumſtances, to ſet forth the power of God, as that the king gaue a ſtraite charge, and with ſo great anger cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the fornace to be heated, and that his ſtrong men were conſumed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vtmoſt flame, where as they thrée walked in the coales in the fire and the flame. And this is as much as if the prophet had ſayd, that the fire had no force at all vpon the holy ſeruauntes of God, and that the ſmoke had
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7787:41"/> killed the kinges ſeruauntes. Therfore ſayth he that thoſe thrée did fall downe in the fire. Then ſurely they could not helpe themſelues nor finde any ſhift to eſcape. Further he ſayth, that they fell downe bound: wherfore naturally they ſhould at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt brunt haue bene choked and ſmothered, and afterward haue bene conſumed: yet doo they remayne ſafe and walke vp and downe loſe in the fornace. We ſée then that the power of God is ſo euident, that the diuell coulde darken it with no lyes. And that the vtmoſt flame doth deuourethe kinges Garde, of the other part God doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue this to be his worke. And this is the end of the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that theſe thrée men were preſerued miraculouſly and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue their hope.</p>
                     <p>Now, by this example we may learne that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better nor more ſafe for vs, then to make God the kéeper and defender of our life. Yet may we not preciſely looke alwayes to be defended and deliuered from all perill: For we doo ſée both theſe thinges to be in the harts of theſe thrée holy men: firſt to hope for deliueraunce if God ſée it good: ſecondly that they doubted not to dye with out feare, if it ſo pleaſed God. Howbeit this muſt we gather of this preſent hiſtory, that there is helpe enough for vs in God, if he will prolong our life. And we know that our life is deare vnto him. Therefore let vs leaue it vnto his pleaſure, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deliuer vs from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t perill, or to take vs to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life, as he thinketh beſt. For in <hi>Peter</hi> we haue both theſe examples. <hi>Peter</hi> was deliuered forth of priſon when as a litle after he muſt dye. Then God declared that he had a care ouer the life of his ſeruaunt. Afterward <hi>Peter</hi> dyed: then was there no miracle. Why ſo? becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed the end of his vocation. Thus the Lord as oft as is expedient, will ſhew his power to preſerue vs: but if he will haue vs go vnto death, let vs ſurely thinke that there is no better thing for vs then to dye, and that it is hurtfull vnto vs to go about to prolong our life any longer.</p>

                     <p>There is no doubt but that God ſent one of his Angels who by his preſence might comfort the mindes of theſe holy
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7787:42"/> men that they ſhould not faynt: for this was a fearefull ſpectacle when they did ſée the fornace ſo flaming and them ſelues caſt therin. God therefore would thus comfort their carefulnes and mitigate their ſorow, when he ſendeth an Angell to be their companion. We know ſometimes that many Angells haue bene ſent for the comfort of one man,<note place="margin">2. king. 6.15 Pſal. 91.11 34.8.</note> as we reade of <hi>Elizeus.</hi> And this is a generall rule: <hi>He hath geuen his Angels charge ouer thee, that they may keepe thee in all thy wayes.</hi> Agayne: <hi>The Angels pitch their tentes round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thoſe that feare God.</hi> The which ſentences doo chiefely belong vnto Chriſt, but they are extended to the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Church and to euery member therof.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore God hath his armies in redines by whom he can preſerue his. And we reade ſometimes that one Angell is ſent to a whole nation. For God néedeth not his Angels when he vſeth their miniſtry, but he thus relieueth our infirmity. And when we doo not attribute vnto hys power ſo much as we ſhould, he ſendeth his Angels to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our doubtfulnes: as we haue ſayd, that there was one Angell geuen to theſe thrée men, whom <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> calleth the ſonne of God: not that he thought that he was Chriſt: but we know that that was commonly receaued among all people, that the Angels were called the ſonnes of God, becauſe there appeared in them a certayne diuinity. Therefore they did commonly call all the Angels the ſonnes of God. And according to this vſuall cuſtome <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezer</hi> ſayth, that the fourth man was like the ſonne of God. For he coulde not know the onely begotten ſonne of God, which was blinded with ſo many wicked errors, as we haue ſeene before.</p>

And now <hi>Daniel</hi> declareth how ſoone hys pride was brought downe and his cruelty qualed. But it is to be noted, that the king was not ſo chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that hee did caſt of wholly his old nature and maners. For when he was touched with this preſent miracle, hée did in déede geue glory vnto God, but it was for a moment: he did not earneſtly repent. And ſuch examples are diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be noted: for many men by one fact will iudge of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7787:43"/> man. Howbeit the moſt wicked contemners of God may for a tyme ſubmit them ſelues vnto hym, and ſhall not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble it in the ſight of men, but ſhal do it earneſtly: becauſe that GOD verely doth compell them thereunto with hys power: yet in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane ſeaſon they kepe within their hartes both pride and cruelty. Such was the turnyng of kyng <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezer.</hi> For he being amaſed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miracle, could reſiſt God no longer: yet he was not conſtant in his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as we ſhall ſée afterward.</p>
                     <p>Let vs know therfore that the wicked which are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate with the ſpirite of God, are driuen many times to worſhyp God: but this is onely a particulare motion in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the reſt of their lyfe doth not aunſwere vnto it. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God reformeth his ſeruaunts, he alſo taketh in hand to gouerne them vnto the end, and doth encorage them to perſeuerance, and confirmeth them with his ſpirite. Yet is it to be marked that the glory of God is ſet forth by this temporall and chaungeable conuerſion of the wicked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, will they nill they, they are compelled to geue place vnto God for a tyme: wherby the greatnes of his power is knowen. God doth therfore cauſe that to ſerue to his glory which doth nothyng profite the reprobate, but rather tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto them to a greater iudgement. For <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezer</hi> was leſſe to be excuſed after that he knowledged the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be the moſt high and onely God, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtraight wayes returned to his ſuperſtitions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Daniel</hi> ſayth that hee came neare to the mouth of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, and that he ſaid: <hi>Sadrach, Meſach, <hi>and</hi> Abednego <hi>the ſeruauntes of the hie God, go forth and come hether.</hi>
                        </hi> A little before he would haue had his Image worſhypped, and that to be counted the onely God in heauen and in earth, onely becauſe it was his pleaſure. For we ſée that he did chalenge ſo much to hym ſelfe that he would haue all Religion and worſhyp of God ſubiect to his luſt and pleaſure: but now as though he were a new man, he calleth <hi>Sadrach, Meſach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> the ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of the high God. What place then doth he put him ſelfe in and all the <hi>Chaldees?</hi> Verely
<pb facs="tcp:7787:44"/> that they do worſhyp fayned Gods and Idols, which they haue forged for them ſelues. But God dyd wryng out this word from the cruell and proud kyng: like as wicked men are compelled by tormentes to ſpeake that they would not.</p>
                     <p>Thus therfore doth <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> confeſſe the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be the hye God, as though he had bene vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the racke, but not willyngly neither of a well diſpoſed minde. He doth not diſſemble this before men (as I haue ſayd) but his minde was neither pure nor vpright, but onely boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out with a particular motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſo that we may ſay that this was rather a violent then a voluntary motion.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Daniel</hi> ſayth that his companions came forth of the middes of the fire. By the which wordes he confirmeth agayne this miracle. For God might haue quenched the fire of the fornace: but he would haue it burne in the ſight of all men, that thereby the power of this deliueraunce might be more euident. And by the way this is to be noted, that theſe thrée men walked in the fornace whiles the kyng commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to come forth: becauſe God had geuen them none other commaundement, They dyd ſée that they remayned ſafe and ſound in the middes of the fornace. They were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with that preſent benefite of God, and they thought not them ſelues at libertie, whiles that by the kynges voyce they were called forth.<note place="margin">Gen. 8.16.</note> Like as when <hi>Noah</hi> was in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Arke he did ſée his health and life to lye as it were in the graue: therfore did he attempt nothyng whiles he was commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to go forth.

And he nombreth certaine partes, which do more clearely proue that theſe thrée were ſaued by none other meanes but by the ſingular benefite of God. For he ſayth that the fire had no power in their bodyes: agayne, that there was not one heare of their head burnt: thirdly that their garment was not chaunged: laſt of all that there was not any ſmell of fire vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them.

                     <p>Finally hee ſheweth that this miraculous deliueraunce was manifeſt, becauſe theſe thrée come forth of the fornace, and the Princes, Dukes, &amp; nobles were witneſſes of Gods power.

                     <p>This is a rare confeſſion of a kyng: but it will appeare by proceſſe that he was caried with a ſodaine vehemency, and that there was no liuely roote of the feare of God in his hart. And I do repete this agayne that we may know, that true repentaunce doth not conſiſt in one worke or twaine, but in perſeuerance &amp; continuance, as Paul ſayth: <hi>If you do lyue in the ſpirite, walke ye in the ſpirite.</hi> Where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth conſtancy of the faithfull,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.25.</note> that they may ſhew them ſelues to be truly regenerate by the ſpirite of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> therefore, as one rauiſhed in ſpirite, magnifieth the God of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> but in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time he min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleth his Idoles with the true God.

Howbeit he doth not ſo, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was his confeſſion but feined: not that he went about to diſſemble with men to get their fauour, but he deceiued him ſelfe as hypocrites vſe to do. He pronounceth the God of <hi>Sadrach, Meſach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> to be bleſſed. If he had done this purely, he ſhould haue curſed all his Idols: For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory of the true and onely God can not be extolled &amp; mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, vnles all the Idols be brought to nought. For wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſtandeth the prayſe of God, but that he alone haue the

                     </p>
                     <p>He addeth: <hi>Which ſent his angell and deliuered his ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</hi> Here <hi>Daniel</hi> more plainely declareth that <hi>Nebuchadne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer</hi> was not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted to receiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> &amp; to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him truely with a pure affection of his hart. Why ſo? For true holines is alway grounded in the knowledge of the true God, which requireth doctrine. <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> did know that the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was the hye God. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by? Verely by his power: for he had a ſpectacle ſet before his eyes which he could not contemne though he would. Thus then doth he graunt the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be the hye God, taught by this miracle. But this is not ſufficient vnto true holynes (as I haue admoniſhed) except alſo doctrine be ioyned vnto it, yea &amp; haue the chief partes. I do grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t very well that men are prepared vnto faith by miracles: but if nothing ſaue bare miracles appeare, and no knowledge be ioyned out of the very word of God, it wilbe but a ſhadow of faith: as we haue here a moſt manifeſt example.</p>
                     <p>Let vs know then that this was a particular fayth in king <hi>Nebuchadnezer.</hi> For he had all his minde bent vpon the miracle, and beyng content with that ſpectacle, he did not inquire who was that God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or what his law did comprehend, neither yet was be carefull for the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Finally he neglected and deſpiſed the whole ſubſtaunce of true holines, and tooke hold vnaduiſedly but of one part onely. This do we ſée dayly in many prophane men. For God many tymes doth humble them and cauſeth them to flye vnto him for ſuccour: but in the meane ſeaſon they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine wrapped in their owne wittes, and do not renounce their ſuperſtitions, neither regarde which is the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God. For to approue our ſeruice vnto God, this principle muſt be remembred,<note place="margin">Ro. 14.23.</note> that nothing doth pleaſe him which is not of faith: and that faith can not be conceaued by any miracle or by any ſenſe of diuine power, but that it
<pb facs="tcp:7787:46"/> muſt haue doctrine alſo. For miracles are of force onely to prepare the minde or to confirme Religion: but of them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues they can not bryng men to the true worſhip of God.</p>
                     <p>And this is merueilous that this prophane kyng ſayth that an Angell was ſent from God, ſaue that it is euident in the prophane writers, that there was alway ſome thyng knowne of the angels. This was a certaine before concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued perſuaſion of the angels: lyke as alſo amongeſt all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there is ſome taſt that there is a God. And where <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> ſayd before that the fourth which was in the fornace was called the ſonne of God by the kyng of <hi>Babel,</hi> eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as I haue ſayd, <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> profeſſed hymſelfe that he vnderſtode ſomething of the Angels: but now he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth more plainly, that God hath ſent his Angell. And how the Angels do helpe the elect and the faythfull, I there tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched briefly, and I do not vſe to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d long vpon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For thys place it is enough to note, that the wicked which neuer heard any thing of God or of true holines, did yet holde this principle, that God vſeth the miniſtery of his Angels to ſaue hys. And thys moued <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> to ſay, that an Angell was ſent from God to delyuer hys ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes.</p>
                     <p>Then he addeth: <hi>Which truſted in hym.</hi> Which is alſo to be noted, for it is added as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe why theſe thrée were ſo meruelouſly deliuered: becauſe they put their truſt in God. And although <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> was but almoſt like a ſtock or a blocke concerning the doctrine of fayth: yet God would teach vs by this ſtone or blocke, and make vs aſhamed, and lay vnto our charge the want of fayth, which cauſeth that we can not commit our liues to Gods will, and boldly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake all daungers whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> néede requireth. For if we were fully perſwaded that God is the kéeper of our life, ſurely no manaces, no threatninges, no terrours, no nor finally any deathes could ſtoppe vs from goyng forward in our office. But infidelitie and diſtruſt in God is the cauſe of our ſlouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes: and ſo often as we turne forth of the way, ſo often as we defraude God of hys honor, ſo often as we faile trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7787:46"/> the want of our fayth doth vtter it ſelfe, and may, as it were, be palpably felt and ſéene.</p>
                     <p>Let vs learne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if we wil haue our life defended with the hand of God, to geue our ſelues wholy vnto him: for he wyll neuer deceaue vs, if that we reſt in him. We do ſée that <hi>Sadrach, Meſach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> were vncertaine of the end: yet this could not diminiſh nor abate their hope and confidence in God: for they vſed this <hi>Dilemna</hi> ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of two partes: either God will deliuer vs from the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fornace, or if we die he wyll ſaue vs after a farre better ſorte, for he will gather vs into hys kingdome. Although then they durſt not promiſe themſelues the thing that they knew not, yet they layd vp their liues in the hand and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of God. Wherefore they are worthely commended by <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> that they truſted in theyr God.</p>
                     <p>Afterward he ſayth: <hi>that they chaunged the kinges decree,</hi> that is to ſay, that they did not regard it, but rather did diſanull it, as hauing greater authoritie. For who ſo ſetleth hymſelf vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, he eaſely deſpiſeth all mortall me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory &amp; hautines in all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world. And this ſentence is worthy to be noted, that fayth is firſt layd for the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> magnanimitie, boldnes, &amp; conſtancy wherewith <hi>Sadrach, Meſach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> were endued: becauſe that whoſoeuer reſteth vpon God, he can neuer be turned away from doyng his office, and though neuer ſo many daungers be offered, yet ſhall he be caried a loft thorow all, by the wynges of hys fayth. So that he which knoweth that God ſtandeth of his ſide, is aboue all the world, that he neyther is aſtoniſhed at the ſcepters and crownes of kings, nor feareth their power, but ouercommeth all hautines in the earth that ſhall ſtand againſt him, and will neuer turne backe from hys right courſe.</p>
                     <p>He ſayth afterward: <hi>that they gaue theyr bodyes, lest they ſhould worſhip any but theyr owne God.</hi> Many that boaſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues Chriſtians now a dayes would ouerthrow and diſalow that thing which thys wicked king is compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to prayſe in theſe thrée perſons. For they do imagine
<pb facs="tcp:7787:47"/> that fayth ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be buried in the hart, and bring forth no fruit of confeſſion. There is no doubt but that God wyll haue al theſe thynges rehearſed by hys Prophet, that theyr crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes may be deteſtable vnto vs which would defraud God of his lawfull honor, and yet would, as it were, ſtoppe hys eyes that he ſhould not eſpy the iniury that is done vnto hym. Such are vnworthy to be reproued by the wrod of God: and <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> is here ſet theyr mayſter, theyr correcter and theyr iudge.</p>
                     <p>Thys alſo muſt be noted, that <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> doth prayſe theſe thrée men becauſe they refuſed to worſhip any God but theyr owne God. And why then did he mingle his multitudes of God? for he departed not from hys errors to geue hymſelfe wholy to the God of Iſraell, and to embrace hys true worſhip. Why doth he prayſe that in others, which he himſelfe doth not folow? But this is a thyng ouer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. For we ſée that vertue is prayſed, and yet goeth coldly forward. For many thinke it ſufficient with theyr lyppes and toungs to do their office. Howbeit though <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezer</hi> dyd ſéeme to hymſelfe to ſpeake earneſtly, yet dyd he not conſider hymſelf: and ſo thys tooke away the whole pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of all excuſe: For he could not afterward pretend ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce and error, when he wyth hys owne mouth had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that none other God was to be worſhipped.</p>
                     <p>Let them therefore now be aſhamed which will be called Chriſtians, vnles they be frée from all wicked ſuperſtitions, and conſecrate themſelues wholy vnto God and retayne hys pure worſhip. Thys is alſo to be conſidered, that the kyng <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> did not ſimply prayſe the conſtancy of theſe thrée men, becauſe they do not worſhip euery God: but alſo do acknowledge the God of <hi>Iſraell</hi> to be the true God. Whereupon it followeth that all other were fayned and mere vanity. But he ſpake thys wythout aduiſement, for God had not lyuely touched hys hart as he vſeth to worke in hys elect, whom he doth regenerate.</p>

                     <p>Here <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> is puſhed further forward: for I muſt uſe thys worde, becauſe he doth not receaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the true God in hys hart to forſake his errors, as I haue ſayd. It is therefore as though God did thruſt hym forth by force to publiſh thys decrée. The decrée in déede of it ſelfe is commendable and Godly, but <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> was caryed wyth a blynde and ſuddayne motion, becauſe Godlines had taken no roote in hys hart. Therefore is he alway onely beholding the miracle. So is hys fayth parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and alſo the feare of God in hym was fruitles. Why then doth <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> ſéeme to be a patrone of Gods glory? Verely becauſe he was afraid by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miracle. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beyng not otherwayſe moued, he could not be retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the reuerence of one God. Finally thys zeale that he pretendeth is nothyng els but a motion that eaſely vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth. And thys is profitable to be noted. For we ſée many caried wyth a vehement zeale to ſet forth Gods glory, but becauſe they want knowledge and iudgement, thys can not be counted prayſe worthy. And many alſo do much more wickedly, as we ſée in Popery, where many proclamations of kynges and Princes flie abroad. If a man aſke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what maketh them ſo hote and feruent that they ſpare not mans bloud? forſooth they prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a zeale of God: but it is a mere raging madnes where true knowledge doth not guide it. We muſt conſider therefore that no law can be made nor any decrée publiſhed of religion and of the worſhip of God, except the true knowledge of God confirme it, and be ſene in it. <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> verely in thys decrée had a good ground: but (as I haue ſayd) it was onely a particular motion in hym. But they that wyll now bée counted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb facs="tcp:7787:48"/> Princes, do onely rage vnder the pretence of a zeale, and ſo lyke cruell beaſtes do ſheed innocent bloud. Wherefore? Becauſe they do not diſcerne betwixt the true God and the Idols. But this ſhalbe touched afterward.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> doth extol the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But how doth he know that he is the high God? Verely by one token of hys power onely. But he deſpiſed that which was the principall: to vnderſtand by the law and the Prophetes who that God was and what was hys wyll. So do we ſée the glory of God to be maintayned but in one part only: and in the meane ſeaſon that which was the chife in hys worſhip and in true holynes, to be deſpiſed and left out. The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is great, that he ſhould be cut in péeces and hys his houſe made a Iakes which ſpeaketh blaſphemy againſt the God of Iſraell. Where we note, that ſeuerity is not to be condemned, where the true worſhip of God is maintayned euen wyth ſleit puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes. But we muſt be aſſured of a true iudgement in the cauſe. But of this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo I wyll ſpeake afterward. As for that which followeth: <hi>that there is none other God which can deliuer after this maner,</hi> it doth confirme that which I touched before: that this king did not regard in hys decrée, eyther the law of God, or any other part of religion, but onely that he was moued by this miracle, ſo that he neither could nor would ſuffer any thing to be ſpoken in reproch agaynſt the God of <hi>Iſraell.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thys onely thyng is worthy blame in this decrée, that he doth not enquire nor ſearch who is that God, that he may be drawen by a ſure perſwaſion to publiſh the decrée.</p>

Howbeit ſeing this varietie doth neither obſcure the ſenſe nor make it doubtfull, we ought not to be troubled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. The ſumme of this chapter is: Becauſe that <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezer</hi> was playnly taught, that the only God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell was to be worſhipped, and he was compelled to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe this for a ſpace, yet becauſe he departed not from hys ſuperſticions, yea and what ſo euer he had conceiued of the true God it reſted not in his hart, but vaniſhed away by and by: therefore is he worthely puniſhed like a beaſt for ſo great ingratitude. God would haue him to be more and more blinded, as he vſeth to doo with the reprobate, and ſometimes with the elect alſo. When they will runne from ſinne to ſinne, God lowſeth them the reyne till they caſt them ſelues down headlong. Afterward eyther he reacheth them his hand, or he draweth them backe with hys ſecret power, or bringeth them into order by hys rods and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and ſo humbleth them. Thus dyd he with the king of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We will conſider the dreame afterward: but here we briefely note that the king was admoniſhed that he might perceiue in the end, that he had no excuſe of his ſtubbernes and contempt. God might worthely in déede haue ſtricken hym as ſoone as hee dyd ſée that he was not truely conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: but before God would puniſh hym ſo ſeuerely (as we ſhall ſée afterward) he would moniſh hym, to proue if there were any hope of repentance. And although he dyd ſéeme to receiue that thing with great modeſty that God
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7787:49"/> declared by the dreame, and <hi>Daniel</hi> dyd interpretate vnto hym, yet dyd he profeſſe with hys toung that which he had not in his hart. And thys thing is manifeſt, becauſe that where he ought to haue trembled, to haue bene carefull and to take héede vnto him ſelfe, yet ceaſed he not from hys pride, but boaſted him ſelfe to be a king of kinges, &amp; <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> to be the quéene of all the world. Becauſe therefore he dyd ſpeake ſo proudly after he was admoniſhed by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, we perceiue that the dreame dyd nothing profit hym. But God by this meanes would make hym more inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable. Agayne, although no fruite therof did ſtraight wayes appeare, yet by long proceſſe of time, when God touched his hart he did know more playnely that this puniſhment was ſent vnto him of God. Therefore was this dreame an entrey and as it were a preparatiue to repentance. And lyke as the ſéede ſemeth to putrify in the earth before it bring forth his fruite: ſo alſo ſometymes God worketh ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely, &amp; cauſeth that his doctrine which ſemed vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a long time, becommeth at the length fruitefull and of force. Now come I to the wordes.</p>
                     <p>The preface of the decrée is: <hi>Nebuchadnezer the king to all people, nations and langages which dwell in all the world:</hi> that is, vnder his dominion. For he would not haue this vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of <hi>Scithia</hi> or <hi>Fraunce,</hi> or other farre countreys, but becauſe his dominion ſtretched farre and wide, he ſpake proudly: as we ſée the <hi>Romanes</hi> call theyr <hi>Rome</hi> the imperiall ſea of all the world, yet were they not lordes ouer all. <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> therefore doth here proudly ſet forth the largenes of his Monarchy, when he ſendeth forth his decrée to all people and nations vpon the whole earth. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he ioyneth this: <hi>I thought it good to declare the ſignes &amp; wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me.</hi> There is no doubt, but that at length he perceiued that he was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for his ingratitude, becauſe that he had geuen glory vnto the one and true God, onely by toung and outward ſhew, and afterward fell agayne to his olde ſuperſtitions, yea he would neuer caſt them of at all. Therefore do we ſée
<pb facs="tcp:7787:50"/> that this king was oft chaſtiſed before he would take profit of Gods correction.</p>
                     <p>Let vs not merueile then if God doo often ſmite vs with his hand, for dayly experience doth try vs to be ſlouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and very ſluggardes at Gods admonitions. When God therefore will bring vs to repentance, he muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity beate vs oftentimes, becauſe either we are nothing moued when we are chaſtiſed by his hand, or if that we doo ſeme for one time wakened, yet doo we returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne by and by to our olde ſinfull ſlumber. It is of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie therefore that the ſcourges be doubled. This do we ſée in this preſent hiſtory as in a glaſſe. How be it this was a ſingular benefit of God, that <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> did geue place at the length, after that God had chaſtiſed him many times. Yet know we not whether this confeſſion came forth of a true and vnfeyned repentance: I do leaue that in doubt. Yet I doo nothing doubt but that <hi>Daniel</hi> doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe this decrée, to declare that the king was in the end compelled to confeſſe the God of Iſraell to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> onely God, and to publiſh the ſame to all people and nations vnder his dominion.</p>
                     <p>In the meane ceaſon this is to be noted, that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crée of the king is prayſed by the ſpirite of God. For <hi>Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell</hi> doth rehearſe it for none other purpoſe, but to declare the fruite of the conuerſion in the king. Wherefore thys is with out al controuerſy, that king <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> hath teſtified his repentance when he magnified the God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell before all the world, and appoynted a penalty for all them which ſpake blaſphemouſly agaynſt that God. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is this place oft cited by <hi>Auguſtine</hi> agaynſt the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtes:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Epiſt. 166. ad Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtas.</note> for they would haue bene ſuffered ſtill vnpuniſhed when they maliciouſly troubled the Church, when they corrupted the pure doctrine, yea when they tooke vpon them to robbe like theues and rage like murtherers. For it was manifeſt that diuerſe were then murthered by them and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers maymed. When theſe men liued ſo wickedly, yet would they haue their wickednes to go vnpuniſhed: &amp; thys
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7787:50" rendition="simple:additions"/> they helde for a principle, that no man ought to be puniſhed for holding a contrary religion.</p>
                     <p>For the which thing ſome at this day are to much bent to contention. It is euident what they ſéeke. For if a man marke them, they are wicked contemners of God, at the leaſt they would haue nothing to be certayne in religion. Therefore doo they labour to ouerthrow and, as much as in them lyeth, to deſtroy all the principles of religion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they may poure forth theyr poyſon, they ſtriue thus ſtoutly for impunity &amp; deny that heretikes and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers ought to be puniſhed. That impudent <hi>Caſtalio</hi> is one of them, and his felowes, and other ſuch like. Such were then the <hi>Donatiſtes.</hi> And therefore (as I haue ſayd) <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth often times cite thys place, and declareth that it is ſhamefull ſlackenes when Chriſtian princes doo not by puniſhing the heretikes and blaſphemers, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne Gods glory: conſidering that <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> which was neuer truely conuerted, yet by a certayne ſecret inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation publiſhed this decree. How ſo euer it is, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent enohgh to ſuch as are modeſt and voyd of contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that this decree of <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> is commended by the teſtimony of the ſpirite. If it be ſo, it foloweth conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that it is the duety of kinges to defend Gods true worſhip, &amp; to puniſh ſeuerely prophane contemners, who labour either to make nothing of true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or adulterate and corrupt the true doctrine with their errors, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate the vnity of fayth and trouble the concord of the Church. This is playne by the text of the prophet.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> ſayth firſt: <hi>It is good for me to declare the ſignes and the wonders which God hath wrought with me.</hi> At the firſt he began to declare what God had done, but it vaniſhed away. Therefore after that God had twiſe or thriſe chaſtiſed him, at the length he confeſſeth that it is good and glorious for him to declare the wonderfull workes of God. And he breaketh forth into an exclamation: <hi>how great are his ſignes, how wonderfull are his mighty workes? his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is an eternall kingdome and his dominion for euer</hi> It is no
<pb facs="tcp:7787:51"/> doubt but <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> would ſtirre vp his ſubiectes to reade this decrée more diligently, and to know the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes thereof, that they might geue them ſelues to ſerue that true and only God. He calleth the hygh God the God of Iſraell vndoubtedly. Yet doo we not know whether he had caſt away his ſuperſticions or no. And I do rather thinke the contrary, that he had not caſt of his errors, but that he was compelled thus to geue glory vnto the true God. He dyd then ſo knowledge the God of Iſraell to be the hygh God, that he dyd ioyne vnto hym the inferior Gods as companions and mates: as all the faythles haue perceiued that there was one hygh God, but they imagined therewith an heape of other Gods.</p>
                     <p>So then dyd <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> confeſſe the God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell to be the hye God, yet dyd he not correct the Idolatry that was vnder his dominion: yea he mingled altogether his falſe Gods with the God of Iſraell, and ſo left not hys corruption. He doth greatly celebrate Gods glory, but that is not enough vnles all ſuperſtions be aboliſhed, that that only religion which is preſcribed in the word of God may haue place, and the pure and perfit worſhyp of God may only floriſh.</p>
                     <p>To be ſhort, this preface may be ſome token of a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conuerſion. But we ſhall ſée ſtreight wayes, that <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezer</hi> was not wholly pourged from his errors. Wherefore we ought to be the more moued, where we ſée the king wrapped in many errors to be ſo rauiſhed with the admiration of Gods power, that he exclameth &amp; cryeth out becauſe he coulde not expreſſe that which he had in his hart.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere doth <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> declare how hée did know the hye God at length. He doth not ſhew what leſſons he had receaued before, but becauſe his pride was tamed at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth by this dreame, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth he onely make mention thereof. Yet there is no doubt but he called into memory alſo his former dreames and condemned him ſelfe of ingratitude, that he had buried ſo great power of God, and that he had blotted out with wicked obliuion ſo great benefites as God had geuen him. Here then onely he ſpeaketh of the laſt dreame, as we ſhall ſée afterward. But before he come to the dreame, he ſayth: that he was quiet. Whereby he noteth the circumſtance of the tyme, that we may know that hee was corrected of God becauſe proſperitie had made him dronken, and as it were brought him in ſléepe. It is no maruell though it were ſo with him: for it is an old prouerbe, that fulnes engendreth fiercenes, as we do ſée horſes when they are much pampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to kicke, to be fierce and not to abide the rider. The ſame alſo is ſéene amongeſt men. For if God treat them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourably and bountifully, they waxe fiece, they are outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious agaynſt all men, they ſhake of the yoke of God him ſelfe, and in the end they forget that they are men. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng <hi>Dauid</hi> did ſo, what will prophane men do, or ſuch as are ouer much addicted to the word? For <hi>Dauid</hi> doth confeſſe that he was deceiued with hys quietnes and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that he thought nothyng was more to be feared:<note place="margin">Pſal. 30.7</note> 
                        <hi>I ſayd in my felicitie or in my quiet ſtate: J ſhall not bee moued.</hi> And afterward he ſayth: <hi>O Lord thou hast chastiſed me, and J was amaſed.</hi> Seyng that <hi>Dauid</hi> then promiſed vnto him ſelfe perpetuall quietnes in the world, becauſe God had ſpared
<pb facs="tcp:7787:52"/> him for a time, how ought our tranquillitie to be ſuſpected leſt we ſettle in our dregges? <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> therefore doth not recite in vayne that he was quiet in his houſe and floriſhyng in his palace: for this was the cauſe of his bolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and pride that cauſed him to deſpiſe God ſo careleſly.</p>
                     <p>Afterward he addeth: <hi>that he ſaw a dreame and that he was troubled.</hi> He would here without doubt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh his dreame from common dreames which do often riſe either of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> troubling of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> braine, or of cogitations in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day, or of other cauſes, euen as it hath bene ſeene in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place. Neither is it nedeful here to repeate thoſe things which we haue largely ſpoken of before. Let this be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, to perceiue briefly how the dreame may be deſcerned, (whereby GOD did admoniſh him of the puniſhment to come) from other dreames which are either of troubles, or vayne, or without effect. Therfore he ſayth, that he ſaw a dreame, and yet he was waken. For he addeth: <hi>that he had thoughtes vppon hys bed,</hi> and then: <hi>he was troubled wyth the viſions of hys head.</hi> This heape of words doth te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de none other way but that that viſion was an heauenly oracle, of the which we will ſpeake agayne more largely.</p>
                     <p>It foloweth: <hi>that he made a decree: that all the wiſe men of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould be called which myght expounde or make open the interpretation of the dreame.</hi> The kyng, no doubt, did dreame often: neither yet did he cal vnto him euery day the Mages, Southſayers, and Aſtrologians and others which excelled in the ſcience of prophecying, or at the leaſt did profeſſe it. He did not aſke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of al his dreames, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God grafted in his hart, a ſure note wherby he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked this dreame, therefore the kyng could not reſt vntill he heard y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof. So we haue ſéene before, that the authoritie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt dreame of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foure Monarchies and of the euerlaſtyng kingdome of Chriſt was eſtabliſhed: ſo that the kyng perceaued that it came from heauen. And there is ſome differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwixt this dreame and that which we expounded before. For God did blot out of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce of kyng <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> the dreame of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7787:52"/> foure Monarchies: ſo that it was neceſſary that <hi>Daniel</hi> ſhould bryng before the kyng the very dreame, and alſo ſhould interprete it: for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Daniel</hi> was more vnknowen. For although he had profited ſo much that he excelled amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g all the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> yet <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng would leſſe haue marueiled at him if he had bene onely an interpreter of the dreame. Therfore God would get the greater reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his Prophet and his doctrine when he gaue him two partes, that is, that hee ſhould foreſée what the dreame was, and then expound the ſenſe and the end of it. In the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dreame <hi>Daniel</hi> was onely the interpreter. But now God did ſufficiently proue that he was indued with a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly ſpirite, ſo that <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> ſhould call him no more as one of the Mages, but ſhould diſcerne him from all the reſidue.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>We ſayd before that the kyng did thus humbly intreate <hi>Daniel,</hi> becauſe he was brought to an extremitie. For hée did not ſéeke vnto him at the firſt, but conſulted with his enchanters. Whom he then deſpiſed, he is now compelled to worſhip and reuerence. He calleth him <hi>Beltſazar:</hi> the which name doubtles did ſore wounde the hart of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. For he had an other name geuen him of his parentes euen from his infancy, wherby he might know that he was a <hi>Iewe</hi> and that hee had his originall of a holy and elect na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now that his name was chaunged (as we haue ſayd in an other place) it was done vndoubtedly by the craft of
<pb facs="tcp:7787:54"/> the tyraunt, that he might by litle and litle forget his kinred. Therefore kyng <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> would by chaunging his name make the holy ſeruaunt of God degenerate. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as oft as he was called by this name, there is no doubt but that he was much offended. Howbeit he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy the matter becauſe he was a captiue, and (as he dyd know) he had to do with proude and cruel people that were now conquerours. Agayne, in the next verſe <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezer</hi> ſayth that this name was accordyng to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of his God. Wherfore ſeyng <hi>Daniel</hi> had his owne proper name of the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God which his parentes had geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hym, <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> would put away that holy name of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and calleth hym <hi>Beltſazar</hi> in honour: the which name is very like to bee deriued of the name of his Idole. Wherfore this was double grief to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Prophet, that he was ſpotted with ſuch a foule blot, that he bare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> marke of the Idole in his name. But he muſt beare this croſſe alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt the other ſcourges of God. Thus did God exerciſe his ſeruaunt many wayes in the bearyng of his croſſe.</p>
                     <p>Now that hee calleth him the chief of the enchaunters, this doubtles priked y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> minde of this holy Prophet. For he deſired nothing more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be diſceuered from the Mages, who deceaued the whole world with their craftes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions. For although they were excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the knowledge of Aſtrologie, and held ſome principles that were commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, yet we know that they corrupted all ſciences. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Daniel</hi> was not willyng to be counted one of them: but he could not deliuer him ſelfe from this infamie. Thus do we ſée that hys patience was tried diuerſe wayes by Gods appointment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> ſayth farther: <hi>Becauſe J know that the ſpirite of the holy Gods is in thee.</hi> Many do tranſlate, <hi>Angels,</hi> which I miſlike not. For all nations dyd know that there was one hye God, but they feined y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angels to be inferiour Gods. How ſoeuer it is, here <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray his ignoraunce, that is to ſay, that he had yet profited no further in the knowledge of the true God, but that hee
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7787:54" rendition="simple:additions"/> was yet wrapped in his old errours, and holdeth ſtill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gods, as hee was entangled with that ſuperſtition at the firſt.</p>
                     <p>This place may be tranſlated in the ſingular nomber as as ſome do, but ſo it is wraſted, and the reaſon that moueth them is very weake. For they thinke that <hi>Nebuchadne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer</hi> was truly conuerted, which is proued to be falſe by the whole text. And they that are of this opinion would excuſe him of all fault. But ſeyng it is playne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> many teſtimonies of old ignoraunce are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined in this decrée of <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezer,</hi> there is no cauſe why we ſhould chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge any thing of the ſimplicitie of the wordes. Therefore he graunteth to <hi>Daniel</hi> a diuine ſpirite, but in the meane ſeaſon he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth many Gods. <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>the ſpirite of the holy Gods is in thee, and no ſecrete is hid from thee.</hi> As though he ſhould ſay, that <hi>Daniel</hi> was endued with a diuine ſpirite, ſo that what ſo euer hee propounded ſhould eaſily be aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> knew this: why did he not then ſtraight wayes call <hi>Daniel</hi> vnto him whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was in doubt, ſeyng <hi>Daniel</hi> was able to deliuer him from all grief? Here his ingratitude is perceaued, that hee conſulted with hys Mages and neglected <hi>Daniel.</hi> We may ſée then how he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes laboured to runne away from God, vntill that hée was drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by force: wherby it appeareth that he was not truly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted. For repentaunce is voluntary, and they are counted to repent, who returne willingly vnto God from whom they fall: the which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be done without fayth and the loue of God.</p>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7787:55"/> by moderation, yet whether they wyll or no, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to be trées: for it is better to liue vnder a moſt cruell tyraunt, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to liue without any regiment. Let vs imagine that all were of like authority: what wyll ſuch a diſorder bring in the end? No man will geue place to an other: eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man will try what hee were able to do: ſo ſhall there be all licencious liberty to rob and to ſteale, to begile &amp; to kill one an other: finally all mens luſtes ſhall bee ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Therefore haue I ſaid that tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny may better be borne, then a diſſolute diſorder where there is no gouernment at all, where there is none that hath power ouer others to kéepe them in order.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore they diſpute ouer ſubtilly which thinke that a king is here deſcribed which had great vertues: for there was no ſuch excellency of iuſtice and equity in king <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezer.</hi> But firſt of al God would declare vnder this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, how he would haue the world gouerned by a politike order, and therefore appoynteth kynges and Monarches and other magiſtrates. Secondly he would declare that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though tyrantes and other Princes which forget their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, do not performe that which is appoynted vnto them by God, yet the grace of God is alwayes euident in all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires and dominions. The tyrantes go about to extinguiſh all comfort of iuſtice and equity, and to confound all things together: but God in the meane ſeaſon doth reſtraine them by a ſecret and incomprehenſible maner, that they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to be profitable to mankinde, wyll they nyll they. Thys then is to be learned by the figure or the Image of the trée.</p>
                     <p>And where it is added: <hi>That the byrdes of heauen dwelt in the braunches, and the beastes dyd feede of the fruite ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi> this muſt be referred vnto men. For although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beaſtes of the fielde haue ſome commoditie by politicke gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet we know that God did appoynt it for mans ſake. He ſayth then that the beaſtes of the fielde were ſhadowed vnder it, becauſe we are defended vnder the ſhadow and defence of the Magiſtrates: for els there is no ſuch burning
<pb facs="tcp:7787:56" rendition="simple:additions"/> heate of the Sunne that can ſo broyle or ſcorch miſerable men, as if they were ſpoyled of thys ſhield and ſhadow vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the which God would haue them to finde reſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alſo the foules of heauen make their neſtes in the boughes.</hi> Some do make a difference betwixt the birdes and the beaſtes ouer ſubtilly, but I am co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to learne thus much by the Prophet, that men of all ſtates and condition, do féele and perceaue no ſmall vtility by the protection of Princes. For if they were deſtitute of thys ayde and comfort, it were better for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to liue amonges wilde beaſtes, then one to kil an other. And this ſhould be of neceſſity, if we conſider how great a pride is ingendred in vs all, and how blinde loue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of vs haue towardes our ſelues, and how raging our luſtes are. Seing it is ſo then, God declareth by thys dreame, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of what ſtate ſo euer we are, yet ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d we in néede of the helpe of the Maieſtrates. And by meat &amp; féeding and by the ſhadow of the trée, he doth ſignifie the manifolde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities which come vnto vs by politicke order. Some ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> myght obiect, that he néedeth not the Magiſtrate in this or in that poynt: but if we try all the neceſſities of our lyfe, we ſhall finde that thys benefite of God is very neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>Now it followeth: <hi>That the height thereof was great, and that it grew vp vnto the heauens, and that the ſight of it was extended to the endes of the earth.</hi> This is reſtrayned to the Monarchie of Babylon. For there were at that tyme o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kingdomes in the world, but theyr condition was but poore and ſlender: and the <hi>Chaldees</hi> had ſuch a dominion that none of thoſe Princes came to ſuch power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Seyng then there was ſuch excellency in kyng <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezer,</hi> it is no meruell though he be deſcribed by the trée that reacheth to the heauen, and ſpreadeth to the endes of the earth.</p>
                     <p>And where ſome of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Rabbines will haue Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the middeſt of the earth, becauſe it is vnder the ſame line wyth Ieruſalem, it is to fooliſh. And they that ſay that Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem is in the middeſt of the earth, are in a childiſh error, as <hi>Hierome,</hi> and <hi>Origene,</hi> and other of the auncient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7787:56"/> which holde thys principle. But they are worthy to be mocked wyth that aunſwere of <hi>Diogines:</hi> who when he was required to poynt the middeſt of the earth, he touched the earth that was vnder hys féete wyth hys ſtaffe. Then when an other obiected, that it was not the midle of the earth, he ſayd, meaſure thou the earth and thou ſhalt ſée.</p>
                     <p>Where it is ſayd: <hi>That the boughes thereof were beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, and the fruite was plentyfull:</hi> thys may bee referred to the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> opinion of the multitude: for we know how their eyes are daſeled wyth the glory of Princes. For if any be farre more excellent then other by the greatnes of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, all do worſhip and reuerence hym, and are rauiſhed as it were into an admiration, ſo that they are able to iudge nothing. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the imperiall Maieſty or the kinges highnes is ſhewed, they are all amaſed and aſtonied. For they thinke that it is not lawfull for them to beholde what is in thoſe Princes. Seyng then there was ſo great riches &amp; power in king <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> it is no meruaile though y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet do ſay: <hi>that his boughes were beautifull, and hys fruite plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi> But in the meane ſeaſon we muſt reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that which I haue lately ſpoken, that is to ſay, that the bleſſing of God doth ſhine in the Princes, although they be farre from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng theyr offices: for God doth not ſuffer hys grace to be vtterly taken from them &amp; therefore they are compelled to bring forth ſome fruite. It is much better therefore to ſée ſome kynde of dominion, then one equall condition, where euery one woulde plucke forth hys neighboures eyes. And thys is ment by the meate for euery one. The ſecond part of the dreame followeth.</p>
                     <p>Hetherto <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> hath deſcribed the beauty and excellency of his ſtate by the figure of a high trée, which ſhadowed the beaſtes and fed them wyth fruite, and gaue quiet neſtes to the foules of heauen in his braunches. Now followeth the cutting downe of the trée. <hi>I haue ſeene</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>in the viſions of my head vpon my bed, and beholde a watch man and a holy one came downe from the heauens.</hi> There is
<pb facs="tcp:7787:57"/> no doubt but by the watchman he meaneth an angell. He is alſo called holy for a further declaration. And the Angells are ſo called worthely, becauſe they watch continually to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. For they are not ſubiect vnto ſléepe, becauſe they are not nouriſhed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> meate nor drinke, but liue a ſpirituall lyfe: therfore alſo they haue no néede of ſléepe, for we fall into ſléepe by meat and drinke. Finally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Angels haue no bodyes: therefore they watch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes by their ſpirituall nature. Howbeit not onely their nature, but their office is alſo here expreſſed. Therfore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath them alwayes ready at hys appoyntment, and he doth ſend them to execute hys commaundementes, therefore are they called watchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It is read in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pſalme:<note place="margin">Pſal. 10.20.</note> 
                        <hi>Ye Angeles which performe his wyll,</hi> becauſe they go to and fro by an incomparable ſwiftnes, and flye ſtraight wayes from the heauen vnto the earth, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vttermoſt part of the earth vnto the contrary, from the eaſt vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weſt. Becauſe therefore that the Angels are ſo ready to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh that which God commaundeth, they may well be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led watchmen.</p>
                     <p>They are alſo called Saintes or holy, becauſe they are not infected wyth mans filthynes. For we are ſtuffed full of vices and ſinnes, not onely becauſe we dwell vppon the earth, but becauſe we haue gathered corruption of our firſt parentes, which haue poluted all the partes both of body and ſoule. Wherefore <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> doth deſcerne the Angels from mortall men by thys title. For though God doth here ſanctifie his elect, yet ſo long as they dwell in the priſon of theyr fleſh, they neuer come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perfection of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. So is here noted the difference betwixt men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> colde not perceaue this of hymſelfe, but that he was taught of God, that he might vnderſtand the cutting downe of this trée not to come by man, but by Gods appointment.</p>
                     <p>Afterward he ſayth, that the Angell cryed wyth a loude voyce: <hi>Cut downe the tree, beat downe the leaues, breake of the braunches, ſcatter abroad the fruite, and let the beaſts flye fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <pb n="45" facs="tcp:7787:57"/> the ſhadow thereof, and let not the foules of the ayre breede in the braunches.</hi> God would expreſſe by thys figure that the kyng <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> ſhould for a tyme become lyke a beaſt. Neyther may we thinke it any abſurdity, although it be ſomethyng ſtraungely ſpoken, that the trée is named to be ſpoyled of mans hart, for <hi>Daniel</hi> doth now turne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the alligory. Yea <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> himſelfe had the dreame ſo in an alligory, that God yet mixed ſomething whereby he might gather ſome other thing to be noted vnder the figure of the trée. The Angell therefore commaundeth mans hart to be taken from the trée after it was cut downe, and hys boughes and fruites ſpoyled. Then doth he commaund the hart of a beaſt to be geuen vnto it, that hys portion may be wyth the wylde beaſtes of the fielde. But becauſe this muſt be repeated agayne, I paſſe it now the more lightly.</p>
                     <p>Thys is the ſumme: that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> ſhould for a tyme not onely be ſpoyled of hys empire &amp; dominion, but alſo of all humane vnderſtanding, that he ſhould no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing differ from a beaſt, becauſe he was vnworthy to be in the loweſt place of the common people: &amp; though he ſéemed to hym ſelfe farre to excéede all mankinde in dignitie, yet he ſhould be caſt downe and abaſed, that he ſhould not haue the loweſt place amongſt men. Then followeth the order of this puniſhment, when it is ſayd: <hi>Let ſeuen tymes paſſe ouer hym.</hi> Agayne: <hi>Cut not downe hys whole roote, but let hym be watred with the rayne of heauen.</hi> Agayne: <hi>let hys portion be with the wilde beastes.</hi> Although thys be a ſeuere and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble chaſtiſement, when <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> is caſt forth of mans company, and made like the wylde beaſtes, yet thys is ſomewhat, that God doth not plucke him vp by the roots, but wyll haue hys roote to remayne, that it may grow and be a trée, yea that it may be grafted in the owne place, and gather new ſtrength out of the roote. <hi>Daniel</hi> hath reſpect vnto thys, that God layd ſuch a puniſhment vpon king <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezer,</hi> in the which yet he ſhewed ſome token of hys mercy, becauſe he ſpared hym and cut hym not of who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but ſuffered ſome roote to remayne.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:7787:58"/>
                     <p>Where ſome do here diſpute of the mitigation of the payne when God ſéeth men repent, I know not whether thys be a place for it or no. For thys conuerſion of the king was not perfect, as we haue ſéene playnely before. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where God would preſſe hym no more, this ought to be attributed to hys onely mercy, becauſe euen when he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to puniſh mans ſinne moſt ſore, yet in all hys tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall puniſhmentes he leaueth ſome taſt of hys mercy, that the reprobate may remayne inexcuſable. For where they bring thys, that the puniſhment is not mitigated vnles the fault be forgeuen, it is falſe, as we ſée in the example of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab.</hi> For God did not forgeue the fault vnto that wicked kyng: but becauſe he did ſéeme to ſhew ſome tokens of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, God did abſteine from ſharper puniſhment. So alſo may we perceaue the ſame in king <hi>Nebuchadnezer.</hi> God would not plucke hym vp by the rootes (&amp; this is refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the metaphore of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trée) but would haue ſeuen times to paſſe. Some do vnderſtand ſeuen wéekes: others ſeuen yeares, but we ſhall treat thys at large afterward.</p>
                     <p>Now this is laſt of all to be noted, that euen in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the vengeaunce of God towardes this miſerable king, yet were Gods benefites mixed, as appeareth in theſe wordes: <hi>Let hys portion be wyth the beastes of the fielde,</hi> that is to ſay, let hym haue ſome portion of meat to ſuſtaine hys lyfe, and let hym be waſhed wyth the rayne of heauen. God doth ſignifie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> though he would puniſh this kyng, and ſhew an horrible toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hys wrath, yet doth he regarde what he is able to beare, and doth ſo temper the payne, that there remayneth hope in the end. This is the cauſe that he hath meate wyth the beaſtes of the fielde, and hath alſo comfort of the heauenly dew.</p>

                     <p>God doth confirme by this verſe, that which he had ſhewed in a dreame to <hi>Nebuchadnezer. Daniel</hi> therfore ſayth, that the king was certified of a matter of truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was decréed before God and his Angels. The pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is that <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> ſhould know, that he could not eſcape that puniſhment whereof he did ſée the figure in his dreame. There is ſome darkenes in the wordes, but we perceaue the minde of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet. Yet is here a doubt: for it ſemeth an abſurditie to geue vnto the Angells thys power and authority, for this is to make them equall with God. We know that God is the only iudge, and therefore that it pertayneth to him alone to decrée and to pronounce what ſentence he pleaſeth. If this be attributed to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, ſo much ſéemeth to be taken away from Gods hygh dignity: for it is not méete for hys maieſty to admit any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. But we know by the ſcripture, that it is no ſtrange thing, that God taketh hys Angels vnto hym, not as equals, but as miniſters: to whom yet he geueth ſo much honor, that he will admit them to hys counſaile. And
<pb facs="tcp:7787:59"/> ſo are the Angels called Gods counſellers. Wherfore they are named in this place to decrée with God: not of them ſelues at theyr own pleaſure, but becauſe they doo ſubſcribe vnto Gods iudgement.</p>
                     <p>And here muſt we note two perſons to be attributed vnto them. For in the firſt place <hi>Daniel</hi> maketh them to ſubſcribe vnto Gods decrée, afterward he ſayth that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire or demaunde. And thys may well be, that the Angels doo require in theyr peticions that all mortall creatures may be abaſed, that God alone may haue the preeminence, and that al things may thus be brought downe that obſcure the glory of God. It is méete and right that the Angels require thys continually, ſeing we know that there is nothing that they doo more deſire, then that they them ſelues ſhould wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyp God, and all creatures with them. And when they do ſée Gods authoritie to be diminiſhed by mans pride and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy, then doubtles they require thys, that God would bring downe vnder his obedience and yoke thoſe proude men that ſet vp theyr creaſtes agaynſt hym.</p>
                     <p>Now do we ſée why <hi>Daniel</hi> ſayth that thys ſentence is in the decrée of the watchmen and in theyr word a requeſt: as though he ſhould ſay, thou haſt all the Angels thine, aduerſaries. For with one conſent and as it were with one mouth, they do accuſe thee before God, that thou doeſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure his glory, as much as in thee lyeth: and God agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theyr requeſtes, hath decreed to caſt thee away, and to make thee contemptible &amp; ſhamefull before al the world: and thys decree is ratified by all the Angels, as it were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with him and them. For their conſent and ſubſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might haue ſome authority with this prophane king. And doubtles God (as he doth many tymes) doth now accommodate the viſion to this mans capacitie, who was neuer taught in the law, but had only a confuſed knowlege of the diuinity: ſo that he dyd not diſcerne betwix God and the Angels. And yet thys ſentence is alſo true, that the ſentence was publiſhed by the common decree of al the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly army, and that together by ſupplication and requeſt:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7787:59"/> becauſe doubtles the Angels did take it greuouſly, that any thing ſhould be withdrawne from Gods glory, &amp; that there ſhould be ſuch madnes in men, that they would draw and catch to them ſelues that which is proper and peculiar to God alone. This ſeemeth to be the true ſenſe. And ſo that which followeth dependeth well hereof: <hi>that mortall men may know that God hath power ouer the kingdomes of men.</hi> For <hi>Daniel</hi> doth note the end of theyr requeſt: that the Angels would haue Gods authoritie to remayne wholly to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and that nothing ſhould be taken away therefrom by mans churliſh ingratitude. For man can chalenge to him ſelfe neuer ſo little, but he robbeth God of hys due prayſe and glory. Therefore do the Angels craue of God conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually that he would caſt downe all the proud, and that he would not ſuffer hym ſelfe to be defrauded of hys autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but that all power may remayne with hym wholly. And this is diligently to be noted: <hi>that all mortall men may know that the moſt high doth beare rule in the kingdoms of men.</hi> For the moſt wicked will graunt that God hath the chiefe power and authoritie (for they dare not draw him downe from his heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly throne with theyr blaſphemies) but in the meane ſeaſon they imagine that they can both get and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend kingdomes in this world, either by theyr owne power, or riches, or other meanes. Therefore the vnbeleuers would gladly ſhut vp God in heauen, euen as the Epicure fayneth that God vſeth his delicates in idlenes. Therfore <hi>Daniel</hi> ſheweth that God is ſpoyled of his right, except he be acknowledged to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ruler in the kingdome of men, that is, in the earth, that he may humble who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he pleaſeth. So is it alſo ſayd in the Pſalme: <hi>Power is neither from the eaſt nor from the weſt, but from the heauen.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Luk. 1.52.</note> They all do confeſſe this thing: but yet ſcarcely the hundreth man doth thorowly féele in his mynde that God doth rule
<pb facs="tcp:7787:60"/> in this world, ſo that no man can extoll him ſelfe or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne in the degrée of honour, but that it is the peculiar benefit of God.</p>
                     <p>Seing this can be ſo hardly perſwaded vnto men, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> doth here very well expreſſe that he is the hygh ruler in the kingdome of men, that is, he doth not onely exerciſe his power in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but doth gouerne alſo mankinde, &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynteth euery one hys degrée or place, &amp; wil geue it to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he pleaſeth. He ſpeaketh of diuerſe empires in the ſingular nomber: but it is as though he ſhould ſay, that ſome are extolled by Gods appointment, and others caſt downe, and all is as it pleaſeth God. The ſumme is, that euery mans ſtate is geuen him of God, ſo that they which couet to come to any hyghnes either by theyr ambition, or ſcience, or wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1.</note> or riches, profite nothyng at all except God doth as it were ſtretch forth his hand to helpe them vp. <hi>Paul</hi> doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo teach the ſame thing with other wordes, that there is no power but of God: and afterwarde <hi>Daniel</hi> doth often repeate the ſame ſentence.</p>
                     <p>He addeth: <hi>that he will lift vp the humble amongſt men, aboue it.</hi> In thys ſo euident alteration y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of God doth better appeare, whiles he lifteth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the doung thoſe which before were vnknowne and deſpiſed, and doth alſo preferre them before kinges. The prophane men whiles thys com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, do ſay that God playeth, and ſo men are toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by hys hand like balles, that ſometyme they are extolled high, and ſometyme caſt downe to the earth. But they do not wey the cauſe, that is, becauſe God would ſhew by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen documentes, that we are vnder his gouerment, ſo that our ſtate ſhould hang therof: &amp; becauſe we do not apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thys thyng willingly, it is neceſſary that we haue examples ſet before vs, in the which we may be compelled to ſée thys which all men in a manner would gladly be ignoraunt of.</p>
                     <p>Now, we ſée the whole iudgement of the Prophet, that is, that the Angels do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually aſke of God that he would declare hys power to mortall men, and therefore that he would throw downe the proude which do thinke that they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7787:60"/> excell by their owne vertue, or power, or fortune, or helpe of men. Therefore that God might ſhake of from them thys horrible pride that robbeth God of hys honor, the Angels require that he would ouerthrow them, and that he would ſo ſhow that he is the king &amp; ruler, not onely of heauen but alſo of the earth. Now, this did not only happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in one king, but we know that the hiſtoryes are filled with documentes therof. For whereof, or of what ſtate are kinges oftentimes created? And ſeing there was no greater pryde in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi> Empire, we ſée what hath bene done. For God hath brought forth certayne monſters, that we might be aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with ſuch a ſight and ſpectacle, both greekes, and of all partes of the Eaſt, and Spaniardes, and Italia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. For nothing was more monſtrous then certaine Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours. Furthermore theyr beginning is ſo filthye and ſhamefull, that God could no more euidently ſhew that em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pieres are not tranſferred by mans will, nor gotten by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, counſaile, and many armyes, but that they are vnder-hys hand to make ruler whom he will.</p>

                     <p>Here <hi>Daniel</hi> doth recite, that he was after a ſorte aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. And I referre this vnto the ſorow which the holy Prophet conceiued by the horrible puniſhment which God ſhewed vnder this figure. Neither ought it to ſeme maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous that <hi>Daniel</hi> was touched with ſorow for the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the kyng of <hi>Babylon.</hi> For although he was a cruell tyraunt, and ſtraitely handled the Church of God, yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt did deſtroy it: yet becauſe hée was vnder his dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it was mete that he ſhould pray for him. For God did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly commaunde the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſo to do, by the Prophet <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iere. 29.7</note> 
                        <hi>Pray ye for the proſperous state of Babylon, for in the peace therof ſhalbe your peace.</hi> And at the end of ſeuenty yeares it was lawfull for the true worſhippers of God, to pray vnto God to deliuer them: but vntill that time was ended which was before limited by the mouth of the Prophet, it was not lawfull for them either to hate the kyng, or to aſke any ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance at Gods hand. For they did know that he was the executor of Gods iuſt iudgement, and alſo that he was their gouernour, and muſt be holden in the ſtead of their lawfull kyng. Seyng then that <hi>Daniel</hi> was gently intreated of the king, and was by the law of warre made an exile, it was his part to kepe fidelitie vnto his kyng, although he did exerciſe tyranny agaynſt the people of God. This was the cauſe why he conceiued ſuch ſorow by the gryſely viſion.</p>
                     <p>Some thinke that hee was rauiſhed in ſpirite: but me thinke that this doth better agrée. For he doth not ſimply ſay that he was aſtoniſhed, but alſo that he was troubled &amp; afrayde in his owne cogitations. Yet this is to be noted, that the Prophetes were ſtraungely moued when God did pronounce his iudgementes by them. Therfore ſo oft as God ordeined his Prophetes to publiſh great calamities, they were moued with diuerſe affections. For of the one part they pitied mans miſeries, whoſe deſtructions they did ſée draw neare: yet did they pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce boldly that which was commaunded them of God: ſo that ſorow did neuer let them, but that they did their office boldely and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And we may ſée both theſe thinges in <hi>Daniel.</hi> Wherfore
<pb facs="tcp:7787:62"/> this was of good affection that he ſo ſorowed for the kyng, that he was ſpeachles almoſt an houre. And whereas the kyng biddeth him be of good courage and forbiddeth him to feare, here do we ſée painted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> careles ſecurity of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which haue not yet perceaued Gods iudgement and vengeance. The Prophet is afraide, and yet is he without all daunger. For God doth not manace him in any pointe: but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the puniſhment which hee ſéeth appointed for the kyng, geueth him ſome hope of the deliueraunce to draw neare. Why is he the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> afrayde? Forſoth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithfull, euen whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God ſpareth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſheweth him ſelfe mercyfull vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet can they not conſider his iudgementes without feare: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do know that they are alſo gilty of the ſame, and worthy of the ſame puniſhmentes, but that God dealeth more mercyfully with them. Agayny, they neuer put of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s affections, and ſo pitie compelleth them to lament whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſée the wicked deſtroyed, or their vengeance draw neare. For theſe two cauſes are they in heauines and ſorow. But the wicked although God do openly ſommon them and ſet his puniſhmentes before them, are nothing moued, but ſtand amaſed, and either do deride his power openly, or count his threatnynges fables, whiles they be clapt in the neckes. Such an example the Prophete ſetteth vs forth to be ſéene in the king of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who ſaith: <hi>Beltſazar be not afrayde: Let neither the dreame nor the interpretation thereof feare thee.</hi> Yet <hi>Daniel</hi> was afrayde for his ſake. But (as I ſayd before) the faithfull although they perceiue God to be mercyfull, yet do they feare: the wicked ſo long as they reſt in their ſecuritie, are not moued nor troubled with any threatnynges.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Daniel</hi> adioyneth the cauſe of his ſorow. <hi>My Lord</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>let this dreame be to thyne enemyes, and the interpretation therof to thyne aduerſaries.</hi> Here <hi>Daniel</hi> declareth why he was amaſed, euen becauſe he deſired ſuch a horrible puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be turned away from the kinges perſon. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he might worthyly haue abhorred him, yet he did reuerence the power that was geuen him of God. Let vs
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7787:62"/> learne then by the example of this Prophet, to pray for our enemies, and chiefly to pray for kynges though they be ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes, if God hath geuen vs into their handes.

Howbeit of the contrary part <hi>Daniel</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that he is not ſo ouercome with any affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of pity, but that he will go forward in his office and vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſayth:</p>

                     <p>The verſe that went before did ſay, that this dreame did belong to the kyng <hi>Nebuchadnezer.</hi> And it was méete ſo to be expreſſed, for this was a heauy and a ſharpe meſſage to the kyng. And we know how hardely kynges can beare, not onely to be brought into order, but alſo to be ſommoned before Gods iudgement ſeat, there to be beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe with ſhame &amp; reproch. For we know that proſperitie doth make, euen common perſons dronken. What can come vnto kynges then, but that they forgettyng them ſelues to be me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhould exempt them ſelues from all incommodities and griefes, becauſe they do not thinke that they are of the common condition with men? Wherfore, becauſe <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezer</hi> could hardely beare this meſſage, therfore did
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7787:64"/> the Prophet admoniſh him in few wordes, that the cuttyng downe of the trée was but a figure of that ruine and fall which he ſhortly ſhould haue. This doth he proſecute with moe wordes, and ſayth: <hi>They ſhall cast thee from among men, and thy dwellyng ſhalbe with the wilde beaſtes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereas <hi>Daniel</hi> did treate before of the fower Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, there is no doubt; but that the kinges minde was at the firſt time ſtirred and ſore gréeued: but this was much more ſharpe and much more intolerable to the kinges minde, that he is compared to the brute beaſtes, that he is cut of from the company of men, and ſent into the fieldes and woodes to féede with the beaſtes. If <hi>Daniel</hi> had ſayd onely that he ſhould haue bene ſpoyled of his prnicely digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, he would haue bene greatly offended with that abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but when he is caſt downe into this ſo great igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minie &amp; ſhame, there is no doubt but he was raging madde inwardly. Notwithſtanding God dyd bridle his fury, that he dyd not couet to auenge hym ſelfe of thys, which he thought to be an iniury done vnto him. For we ſhall ſee by the text afterward that he did not rightly repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; amend his life. Seing then that he foſtered the ſame pride ſtill in his hart, there is no doubt alſo but he was cruell: for theſe two vices do alway go together. But God reſtrained his rage ſo, that he ſpared this holy Prophet.</p>
                     <p>By the way we may note the conſtancie of the ſeruaunt of God, in that he doth not inſinuate vnto the king by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle meanes what ſhould come vpon him, but openly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with many wordes, how fowle and ſhamefull a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was appoynted for hym. <hi>They ſhall caſt thee out</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>from among men.</hi> If he had ſayd: thou ſhalt be as a common perſon among men, and ſhalt nothing differ from the baſe people, now that had bene very greuous vnto a king. But when the king is caſt out of all humane ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he may not haue one corner amongeſt them, neither is it graunted that he may lead his life with the Neatherdes and Swinherdes: how greauous and horrible this was, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man may coniecture by his owne minde. Yet doth not
<pb facs="tcp:7787:65"/> 
                        <hi>Daniel</hi> here doubt to pronounce this ſore iudgement. And the wordes that folow are of the ſame importance: <hi>Thou ſhalt feede of the graſse, thou ſhalt be watred with the dew of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and thy dwelling ſhalbe with the wilde beaſtes.</hi> Where the prophet teacheth that this puniſhment is at hand vnto the king of Babylon, that he ſhalbe brought to extreame igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny and ſhame, &amp; that he ſhall differ nothing from brute beaſtes. Thys liberty then (as I haue ſayd) is worthy to be noted, that we may know that the ſeruauntes of God which haue the charge to teach and to preach vnto others, can not execute theyr offices faythfully, vnleſſe with cloſe eyes they paſſe by and deſpiſe all the hautines of the world.</p>
                     <p>Agayne, by the example of the king we may learne, that it is in vayne for vs to be ſtubborne and froward when God by his meſſengers threatneth vs. For although <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezer</hi> dyd not rightly repent (as hath bene ſayd, and it wilbe more euident afterward) yet do we ſée how he ſuffered this horrible iudgement of God to be pronounced agaynſt hym. If then we which are but chaffe in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of hym, and of no reputation, can not abide the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges of God when ſo euer they ſhalbe pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt vs, euen he ſhalbe a witnes and iudge agaynſt vs, who though he were in ſo great power and dignity, yet durſt he do nothing agaynſt the prophet.</p>
                     <p>Now in the end of the verſe the ſentence is repeated agayne which was expounded before: <hi>vntill thou know, that the moſt hye beareth rule in the kingdome of men, and he geueth it to whom he will.</hi> Thys place doth teach how hard a thing it is for vs to geue all power vnto God. We are in deede great ſpeakers of the glory of God with our tounges, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit there is no man but he reſtrayneth hys power whiles that he vſurpeth ſome what to hym ſelfe, or turneth ſome what thereof to one or an other. Eſpecially when God doth rayſe vs vp to any honor or dignity, we forget that we are men, and we robbe God of hys honor, and thruſt our ſelues into hys place. Thys diſeaſe is hard to be cured, and thys puniſhment which God hath layd vpon the king of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7787:65"/> 
                        <hi>Babylon</hi> is an example for vs. For God would haue bene content with a ſmaller puniſhment, but becauſe thys mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes doth ſo ſticke in the bowels and mary that men dare chalenge vnto them ſelues that which is peculiar vnto God. Wherefore there muſt needes be ſome ſharpe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decine to teach them modeſty, humility, and méekenes.</p>
                     <p>Kinges and Monarches at thys day do alwayes prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in theyr titles that they are Kinges, Dukes, and Earles by the grace of God: but how many do falſely pretend that name to this end and purpoſe, that they may chalenge to them ſelues authority ouer all? For what meaneth that ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle [by the grace of God] but that they ſhould knowledge no ſuperior? And in the meane ſeaſon they would treade vnder foote God him ſelfe, vnder whoſe ſhielde they mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne and defend them ſelues: ſo farre are they from ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt conſideration that they do reigne by hys benefit and goodnes. Wherefore this is but a mockery, that they boaſt them ſelues to haue theyr authority by the grace of God. Seing it is ſo, we may eaſely iudge how proudly prophane kinges do deſpiſe God, although they do not pretend the name of God deceaueably as theſe vayne tatlers do which mocke God openly and ſo prophane and pollute the name of grace.</p>

                     <p>Here <hi>Daniel</hi> doth end the interpretation of the dreame, and teacheth that God will not ſo ſeuerely deale wyth the king <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> but that he will leaue ſome place for hys mercy. Therefore he doth mitigate the great rigor of the puniſhment, that <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> hoping for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, might call vpon God and repent, as there ſhall folow afterward a more euident exhortation. But now <hi>Daniel</hi> doth prepare hym to repentance, when he ſayth that the
<pb facs="tcp:7787:66"/> kingdome ſhall remayne vnto hym. For God could haue caſt hym out of mans company, ſo that he might alway haue remayned with the wilde beaſtes. He might alſo haue caſt hym ſtreight way out of the world: but thys is a ſigne of clemency, that he will reſtore hym not onely vnto ſome meane ſtate, but to hys owne dignitie, as though hee had bene alway vpright. Therfore we ſée that this dreame had bene profitable to kyng <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> if he had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed the admonition of the holy Propeht: yea if he had not bene vntha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kefull vnto God. For <hi>Daniel</hi> did not onely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warne him of the calamitie which ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged ouer his head, but alſo he brought the meſſage of reconciliation. God therfore had taught him profitably, had he not bene ſtubburne and deſpiſed to learne, as the moſt part of men commonly do.</p>
                     <p>But hereof many we gather a generall doctrine, that when God doth appointe an end for his puniſhmentes, we are moued to repentaunce, becauſe God geueth ſome taſte his mercy, that we may hope to obteine pardon of at hys hand, if we flye vnto him vnfeinedly and in ſinceritie. This alſo is to be noted, that <hi>Daniel</hi> addeth in the ſecond parte of the verſe: <hi>After that thou ſhalt know that the heauens haue the rule.</hi> For vnder theſe wordes is the promiſe of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall grace included, that God would not onely puniſh the kyng of <hi>Babylon</hi> to humble him, but alſo would inwardly worke and chaunge the hart, like as at the length (though long firſt) it came to paſſe.</p>
                     <p>I haue ſayd that the grace of Gods ſpirite is here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed: for we do know how ſmally men do profite with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, although God correct them an hundreth tymes. For the ſtubburnes and rebellion of our hartes is ſo great, that we are rather more and more hardened when God calleth vs to repentance. And doubtles <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> had bene like vnto <hi>Pharao,</hi> ſaue that God did not onely humble him with outward puniſhmentes, but alſo did geue him the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward motion of his ſpirite, that he ſuffered him ſelfe to be taught, and did ſubmit him ſelfe to the power and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of GOD. This meaneth <hi>Daniel</hi> when hee ſayth:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7787:66"/> 
                        <hi>After that thou ſhalt know.</hi> For <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of his owne minde haue come downe to ſuch a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, vnles he had bene touched with ſome ſecrete motion of the ſpirite.</p>
                     <p>He addeth: <hi>That it is the power of heauen:</hi> that is to ſay, that God gouerneth the world and hath the whole rule. For here he ſetteth the heauens, as it were, contrary to the earth and to all mortall creatures. Now, the kynges when they ſée all thinges quiet about them, if no man feare them they thinke that they are ſafe enough, and whiles they will make them ſelues ſure, they looke round about them hether &amp; thether, but they neuer lift vp their eyes to the heauens: as though this perteined nothyng vnto God to mainteine kyngdomes, &amp; to raiſe vp whom he will, and to caſt downe all the proud. As though then that this were not in Gods hand, the Princes of this world do neuer conſider that the heauens haue the authoritie and rule: but (as I haue ſayd) they looke this away and that way, before and behind, euen euery way ſaue onely to the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. This is the cauſe that <hi>Daniel</hi> affirmeth that the heauens beare the rule. He ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth God as it were agaynſt all mortall men, as is before.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:7787:67"/> and vnderſtand at the length that thou oughteſt to repent. This ſemeth to be the meanyng of the wordes. Now for the pointes of the doctrine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Daniel</hi> doth deale more mildly with this prophane king, then if he had preached to his owne countreymen. For the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he would haue vſed his propheticall authoritie, &amp; not haue talked of his owne counſaile. But becauſe he did know that the kyng knew not the firſt principles of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he taketh vpon him the perſon of a counſailer becauſe he was not an ordinary teacher. That <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> had now called him, it was not vſuall euery day, as though he would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him ſelfe to his doctrine. <hi>Daniel</hi> doth therfore conſider with what maner of man he had to do, when he ſayth: <hi>Let my counſaile be acceptable vnto thee,</hi> and then doth vtter it in few wordes: <hi>Breake of thy ſinnes,</hi> [or caſt them from thée] <hi>by rightuouſnes, and thyne iniquities by mercy toward the poore.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is no doubt but that <hi>Daniel</hi> would exhort y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng to repentance: howbeit he doth touch but one kinde, as we do know that it is vſuall in the Prophetes. For when they call the people home, they do not alway comprehend what repentance is, neither do they generally deſcribe it, but they touch by a figure, either the outward declaration therof, or ſome part of it, eſpecially wherin men are moſt fauty. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> doth ſo now.</p>
                     <p>If thou do aſke what is repentance: it is the turnyng a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne of man vnto God, from whom he was departed. And is this conuerſion and returnyng onely in the handes, and the feete, and the tounge? Nay, it rather begynneth in the hart, and then it goeth forth into outward workes. True repentaunce then beginneth in the minde of man: to wit, that he which would be wiſe in his owne conceit, ſhould now renounce his owne wiſedome and forſake the fooliſhe confidence in his own wyt, and then that he ſhould ſubdue his wicked and corrupt affections and ſubmit them vnto God: then ſhall folow the reformation of the life outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Howbeit the workes are but teſtimonies of repentance. For repentaunce (as I ſayd) is a thyng more pure and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7787:67"/> then that the roote therof can euidently be ſéene with mans eye. By the fruites therfore do we onely teſtifie our repentance. But becauſe the workes of the ſecond table do, as it were open and declare mans mynde what it is, therfore the Prophetes often tymes when they require re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, do onely ſet forth the workes of charitie, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> here doth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Breake of thy ſinnes</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>with righteouſnes.</hi> When men do ſée that they are called to repentaunce and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of lyfe, they do fayne vnto themſelues many prety kindes of ſeruice, which yet are not worthy to be accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Gods ſeruice, becauſe they do not regard what doth pleaſe God, neyther yet what he commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth by his word: but as they themſelues do allow thys or that, they do wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regarde obtrude it vnto God, as we do ſée in Popery. For what call they an holy and iuſt lyfe amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt them? To trot hether and thether, to vow and go pilgrimages, then to ſet vp ſome Image, to found ſome Maſſes, to faſt thys or that day, and to heap vp ſuch a ſort of fond toyes, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which God hath neuer ſpoken one word. Becauſe therefore that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do ſo farre &amp; ſo groſly wander a ſtray in the knowledge of true iuſtice, the Prophet doth here ioyne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as an expoſition, as though he ſhould ſay: Do not thinke that God is pleaſed wyth outward pomps &amp; ſhewes which do pleaſe men, as they are carnall and addicte to earthly thynges, and therefore do they wickedly eſteme God after theyr owne diſpoſition. Let not thys vanity therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile thée: but know thou that true iuſtice ſtandeth in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion toward the poore.</p>
                     <p>Alſo in this ſecond member the part is named for the whole, by a figure called <hi>Sinecdoche:</hi> for true iuſtice is not reſtreined to this matter ſimply, but to all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> workes of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. We muſt then deale faythfully wyth all men, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beguile rich nor poore, neyther yet be greuous vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but geue vnto euery man that which is hys owne, as apperteineth. And thys manner of ſpeaking ought to be well known of vs, if we be any thyng exerciſed in the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
<pb facs="tcp:7787:68"/> of the Prophetes. How ſo euer it is, <hi>Daniel</hi> woulde hereby ſhew vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of <hi>Babylon,</hi> what it is to liue iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: to wytt, euen to kéepe fidelity and vpright dealing with men: and yet doth he not neglect the firſt table of the law. For the worſhyp of God is more precious then all humane iuſtice, that is to ſay, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any thing that can be done betwixt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and man. Howbeit true iuſtice declareth it ſelfe by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward workes and teſtimonies, as is ſayd before. And he rather ſpeake to of the ſecond table then of the firſt, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whiles hypocrites do prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to worſhip God by ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and many outward ſhewes, they ſuffer themſelues to liue in all cruelty, bribery, craft &amp; deceit, ſo that they care not how they liue wyth their neighboures. Becauſe then that the hypocrites do couer their wickednes vnder thys cloke, God doth ſet forth a touchſtone to try them, when he calleth them to the workes of charity.</p>
                     <p>There may be double vnderſtanding of the end of the verſe. If we retaine the <hi>futer tenſe</hi>] Behold there ſhall be a medicine to thyne error] it is a confirmation of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine that went before: as though he ſhould ſay, thou mayſt not deale by long delayes and vayne ſhiftes, that wyll not ſerue: thys is the onely medicine that I tell thee. Or if we take it as an exhortation, the text wyll go very well: [Let thys be a medecine to thyne errors] that is to ſay, do not folow thy luſtes ſtill as thou haſt done, but open thine eyes and perceaue how miſerably thou haſt liued, and labour to redreſſe thy former errors.</p>
                     <p>Now, where the Papiſtes haue abuſed thys place, to proue that God is pacified with ſacrifices, it is to fooliſh and ridiculous, if we examine their doctrine. For when they wyll define ſatiſfactions, they call them the workes of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerogation. If a man do that which God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded in hys law, yet can he not ſatiſfie for hys ſinnes: as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes are compelled to confeſſe. What remayneth then? Forſooth that we offer more vnto God then he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. Wherefore they call them alſo, <hi>opera indebita,</hi> workes that are not due. But <hi>Daniel</hi> doth not here require
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7787:68"/> of kyng <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> any worke of ſupererogation: but hee requireth iuſtice, &amp; afterward declareth that mans lyfe is not ordered by iuſtice vnleſſe humanity and kindnes be amongſt vs, and eſpecially vnleſſe we be mercifull vnto the poore. Surely here is no worke of ſupererogation. For wherunto tendeth the law? It foloweth the refore that this can not be drawen to the workes of ſatiſfaction, and that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papiſtes are fooliſh and filthy herein.</p>
                     <p>But although we graunt vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this thyng, yet it doth not folow that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſinnes are redemed before God therby, as though the workes could recompence either for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or for the crime. They confeſſe that the crime is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demed with ſatiſfactions: but the puniſhment they ſay is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demed. But ſée how thys agréeth wyth the mynde of the Prophet. I do not ſtriue wyth them now for the word of redemyng, but I would haue them to regard whether thys redemption be in the iudgement of God, or before men. It is certaine that <hi>Daniel</hi> here did regarde how wickedly and cruelty <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> had behaued hymſelfe, how ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannouſly he had vexed hys ſubiectes, how proudly he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore and miſerable that were vnder hym. Becauſe then he had geuen hym ſelfe ſo diſſolutly to all wickednes, <hi>Daniel</hi> declareth the remedy. And though this remedy be taken for a redemption or deliueraunce, there is no abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie: for we redeme our ſinnes wyth men when we ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for them. I do redeme my fault at my neighbours hand, when I do labour to reconcile my ſelfe vnto hym after I haue offended hym, knowledging my crime and aſking for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuenes. And if I haue diminiſhed hys goods, I reſtore that which was vniuſtly taken. Thus do I redeme my crime. But it doth not follow therefore that my ſinnes are purged before the iudgement ſeat of God, as though thys which I do vnto my neighbour were any kynde of recompence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. We ſée therefore how fooliſh the Papiſtes are to abuſe the Prophetes wordes.</p>
                     <p>Here they vſe to demaund a queſtion, to what purpoſe <hi>Daniel</hi> doth exhort the king <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> to breake of
<pb facs="tcp:7787:69"/> hys ſinne, or to redeme hys ſinne? For eyther it was a thyng depending of chaunce (which were a great abſurdity to graunt) or els it was an heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly decrée, like as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dreame of the kyng was a publication of Gods decrée, as we did ſée before. If thys were determined with God, it could by no meanes be chaunged. Therefore it was in vayne to redeme hys ſinne. If we follow the other expoſition of breaking of thys ſinne, there remayneth no doubt. But although we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that the Prophet here doth ſpeake of the redeming of ſinnes, yet is the exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not vnprofitable. For although kyng <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> ſhould haue prepared hymſelfe to beare Gods correction, yet was it not vnprofitable to know God to be mercifull. And the tyme alſo myght haue bene ſhortened, which was prolonged by his oſtinate malice: not that God at any tyme chaungeth hys decrée, but becauſe he often tymes preacheth threatningly vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to cauſe them to repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that he may deale more mercifully wyth them, and reſtraine the rigour of hys vengeaunce, as we ſée by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifolde examples.</p>
                     <p>Thys had not bene then vnprofitable nor fruitles, that <hi>Daniel</hi> exhorted the kyng to redeme or breake of hys ſinne, if the king had conſidered it: for he myght haue found fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour in ſome poynt, although he had bene puniſhed. Yea though there had not bene one day ſhortened of vij. yeares, yet was this no ſmall profite, if the kyng had humbled hym ſelf betymes before God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yet he might be capable of that mercy in the end, which was promiſed. For becauſe the tyme was named by the Prophet, therfore had it bene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for the kyng, if he had prepared hymſelfe to receiue that mercy by humble prayer vnto hys iudge. Wherefore this dictrine was profitable many wayes, lyke as it is vnto vs at thys day. For although we muſt be ready to receiue Gods corrections, yet is thys, no ſmall comfort in our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, when we do ſo ſubmit ourſelues vnto God, that we are perſwaded of the contrary part, that he wyll be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto vs, becauſe he ſeeth vs diſpleaſed wyth our ſinnes and hartely abhorre them.</p>

                     <p>After that <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> hath declared that <hi>Daniel</hi> was the preacher of Gods iudgement vnto him which was at hand, now he addeth how and after what ſort God dyd execute that iudgement which he had pronounced by hys Prophet. He ſpeaketh in the third perſon: but we know how often the chaunging of the perſon is vſed wyth the Hebrues and Chaldees. Furthermore <hi>Daniel</hi> did not write the ſaying of the kyng, but did onely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend the ſumme. So it commeth to paſſe that ſometymes he bringeth in the kyng to ſpeake, &amp; ſometymes he ſpeaketh in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. There is no cauſe therefore why this diuerſitie ſhould trouble vs, for it doth nothing obſcure the ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt verſe <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> teacheth that that dreame which <hi>Daniel</hi> expounded was not in vayne. So he admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth by the effect that followed, that it was a heauenly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle: for other dreames (as we do know) do vaniſh away. But becauſe God did accompliſh at hys due tyme that which he had ſhewed to the kyng of <hi>Babylon</hi> by dreame, hereby it appeareth that it was no trifling dreame, but a certayne and ſure reuelation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> puniſhment which ſhould ſhortly come vpon the kyng. And the manner alſo is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith, that after a yeare was ended, the king did walke in hys palace &amp; boaſted of hys glory &amp; maieſtie, &amp; the ſame moment a voyce came downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherby thys was repeted which he heard before in the dreame. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he declareth how he was caſt forth from the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of men and remayned a long tyme wyth brute beaſtes, ſo that he differed nothing from the beaſtes.</p>
                     <p>Some do thinke that <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> was ſtricke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wyth repentance when he was admoniſhed of the wrath of God, and that for thys cauſe the tyme of hys puniſhment was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. But I thinke not ſo. I thinke rather that God ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hys hand vnto the end of the yeare, that the pride of the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7787:70"/> kyng myght be more inexcuſable. For he ought to haue bene afrayd by that voyce of the Prophet, as though God hymſelf had thundred and lightned from the heauen. Now it appeareth that he was alwayes one. I do not deny in déede, but that he myght be afrayd at the firſt meſſage, and I will not diſpute of that matter. Howſoeuer it is, I do not thinke that God ſpared hym for a tyme becauſe he did ſhew any token of repentaunce. I graunt that God doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſpare the reprobate if he ſée the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> humbled, as we haue a moſt playne example in king <hi>Achab.</hi> For <hi>Achab</hi> dyd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer repent hartely:<note place="margin">King 21.</note> but God would ſhew how much repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance pleaſed hym, whiles he pardoned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate king in hys malice for ſome ſmall ſigne of repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taunce.</p>
                     <p>The ſame might be ſpoken of kyng <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> if the Scripture did teach it. But, as may be gathered by the wordes of the Prophet, <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> went forward in his pride, vntill his careles negligence came to the higheſt. For thys was intolerable, that after God had threatned ſo ſore, the king remained yet in hys pride. It is a monſtrous dulnes that he could remaine careles, although he had liued a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth yeares after that threatning. Finally I do thinke that although <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> dyd vnderſtand that a ſore and horrible puniſhment was prepared for hym, yet though he were afrayd for a tyme, he dyd not lay downe hys pride and hye mynde. In the meane ſeaſon, that prophecy might ſéeme vayne, &amp; it is probable y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the thing which he had heard was now a long time gone out of hys mynde: Like as the wicked are wont to abuſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> long ſufferaunce of God, and ſo heape vnto themſelues the treaſure of greater ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geaunce, as <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth, <hi>Rom. 2.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> Wherefore it may be that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided thys prophecy, and ſo was more and more hardened. Howſoeuer it is, there can none other thing be gathered by the text of the Prophet, then that the admonition of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet was then in vayne, yea that the oracle it ſelfe was of no force whereby he was called to repentaunce.</p>
                     <p>If there had bene any droppe of a Godly mynde in hym, truely he ſhould haue fled to the mercy of God, he ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:7787:71"/> haue weighed with hymſelfe by how many wayes he had prouoked hys wrath, he ſhould haue geuen hymſelfe wholy to the workes of charity: as he had executed greuous tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny agaynſt all, ſo ſhould he haue geuen hymſelfe to huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and mercy, as the Prophet had exhorted hym: but he is ſo farre from doing thys, that he doth vomit out vayne boaſtinges, which do ſhew that hys mynde doth ſwell with diſdainfulnes, and alſo with the contempt of God. Becauſe therefore here is noted the ſpace of the tyme, hereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that God will ſometymes deferre hys iudgements, if paraduenture they wyll repent euen which ſéeme altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſperate: But the reprobate do abuſe that humanity and mercy of God, becauſe they do more harde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theyr harts by thys occaſion, whiles they ſuppoſe that God ceaſeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doyng the office of a iudge when he ſuffereth for a ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>At the end</hi> [then] <hi>of twelue monthes, the king walked in hys palace, and ſpake, and ſayd:</hi> Thys doubling of the word, doth expreſſe that the kyng ſpake of a purpoſed pryde. The Prophet myght haue ſayd more ſimply, [the kyng ſpake] but he ſayth, <hi>that he ſpake and ſayd.</hi> Wherby I ſuppoſe that the Prophet meaneth that the king did, as it were vomite forth that which he had before conceaued and purpoſed in his heart: <hi>Is not this that great Babylon, which I haue builte for my kingly pallace by the might of my power, and for the honor of my maieſty.</hi> In theſe wordes we ſee no open blaſphemye which ſhould offend God ſo greatly: but we muſt conſider that the king did ſpeake thus, to challenge vnto him ſelfe all thinges, as though he were in the place of God. And thys may be gathered by the words: <hi>Is not this Babylon the great?</hi> He boaſteth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatnes of hys citie as though he would ſet it againſt the heauens, as the olde Gyants did. <hi>Which,</hi> ſaith he. This Pronowne doth ſeme alſo to be put for vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency. <hi>Which I</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>haue builte, and that with the might of my power.</hi> We ſee how he ſpoyleth God of hys honour, challenging all thinges vnto him ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Yet before I go any further, wee muſt ſee wherefore he ſayth that Babylon was builte of him. For all the Hiſtorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7787:71"/> do agrée in this, that that citie was built of <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramis.</hi> Now, a great whyle after <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> doth declare it for hys prayſe and glory, that he hath built that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. But the aunſwere is eaſie. For we know how earthly kynges do ſtudy by all meanes poſſible to throw downe the glory of others, that onely they myght excell and get to them ſelues a perpetuall name: eſpecially where they chaunge ſome thyng in buildinges, or in palacies, or in Cityes they would ſéeme to be the firſt builders, and ſo blot them out of memory of whom the foundations were layd. So it may be that <hi>Babylon</hi> was beautified of the king <hi>Nebuchadne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer:</hi> therefore doth he tranſlate all the glory vnto himſelfe, whereas the greater part ſhould haue bene aſcribed to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miramis</hi> and <hi>Ninus.</hi> Wherefore it is a tyrannicall kynde of ſpeach, that is, which the tyrauntes do often vſurpe, and commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly whiles they draw to them ſelues other mens prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: Therefore (ſayth he) <hi>I haue built it wyth the ſtrength of my power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now we may eaſely ſée what did diſpleaſe God in thys boaſting of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of <hi>Babylon,</hi> eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſacrilegious boldnes when he ſayth, that the Citie was built by hys owne myght or power. But God ſheweth, that that prayſe is due vnto hym, and worthely:<note place="margin">Pſal. 127.</note> 
                        <hi>For except God builde the City they watch in vayne &amp;c.</hi> Therefore how ſtrongly ſoeuer men labour in building Cityes, yet they profite nothing except God hymſelfe rule the worke. Where as then <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezer</hi> doth magnify hymſelfe, and doth ſet forth the ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of hys power agaynſt God and hys grace, thys arrogant boaſting was intolerable. And thys was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe that God was ſo angry wyth hym. Therefore let vs learne that thys is tryed true by this example which the Scripture doth ſo oftentymes inculcate, that is to ſay,<note place="margin">Pſal. 18.28</note> that God reſiſteth the proud,<note place="margin">Iam. 4.6.</note> that he plucketh downe their hauty lookes and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunces, and that he can not abyde their arrogancy. Where as God therefore in euery place doth pronounce that he is an enemy to the proud, it is confirmed by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.5</note> as if God did hereby ſet forth vnto vs the Image of
<pb facs="tcp:7787:72"/> his iudgement as in a glaſſe. This is one leſſon.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the cauſe is to be noted why God maketh ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> warre agaynſt all the proud: becauſe we can lift vp our heades ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo little, but we fight agaynſt God. For all rule and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is in hys hand, yea our life is in hys hand. Neyther are we any thing neyther can we do any thing, but onely of hym and by hym. Who ſoeuer chalengeth therefore thys or that, be it neuer ſo little, to hymſelfe, he withdraweth ſo much from God. Wherefore it is no maruaile though God do teſtify that he can not abyde the hygh countenaunces of men: for they do wilfully prouoke him to anger when they vſurpe the leaſt thing that can be, vnto themſelues.</p>
                     <p>It is true that Cities are built by the induſtry and labour of men, and that thoſe kynges are worthy commendation that eyther built Cities or fortifie them, ſo that due prayſe remayne vnto God and nothing be taken therefrom. But when men extoll and magnify themſelues, and wyll haue their power ſéene, they bury the bleſſing of God as much as in them lyeth. Then is it neceſſary (as we haue ſayd) that their ſacrilegious temerity robbing God of his honor, be called to accompt.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the kyng ſheweth hys vanity when he ſayth: <hi>I haue built it for my princely palace and for the excellency of my maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie.</hi> By theſe wordes he doth not diſſemble, but that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded hys owne glory in all hys buildinges, to the entent that hys name myght be aduaunced amongeſt hys poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. To be ſhort, therefore would he both in his lyfe and after hys death be thus renowmed in the world, that God ſhould be nothing in reſpect of hym: and ſo all the proud ſhoote at this marke, that they may ſet themſelues in Gods place.</p>
                     <p>It followeth: <hi>The word was yet in the kinges mouth, when a voyce was heard from heauen.</hi> Here we ſée how ſoone God can euen in a moment repreſſe the madnes of them that do outragiouſly extoll the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. And it is no maruaile though this voyce was heard ſodainly, ſeing there had bene a ſpace for repentaunce geuen before vnto the kyng <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezer.</hi> Now in thys kynde of ſpeach: <hi>They ſay vnto
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7787:72"/> thee,</hi> we néede not to be curious to know who ſpake. The name of the kyng is not geuen hym for honor, but in deriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as though he ſhould ſay: thou art dronken wyth thy preſent dignity: for whyles all men do honor thée as a God, thou dooſt forget thyne owne fraility: howbeit this prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Maieſtie and power can not let, but that God can caſt thée downe: becauſe thou wilt not humble thy ſelf willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thy kingdome is departed from thée. Thys was incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible then: for <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> was in a quiet poſſeſſion of the kyngdome. No man did ſhew hymſelfe an enemy, his Monarchy was terrible to all nations: yet doth God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce at that preſent, that the kyngdome was departed from hym. And thys maketh for the certainty of the oracle, that <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> may know that the tyme is now ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, and the puniſhment can no longer be deferred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had ſo abuſed Gods mercy and mocked hys cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency.</p>
                     <p>It followeth: <hi>And they ſhall driue thee from amongest me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and thy dwelling ſhalbe wyth the beastes of the fielde, and they ſhall make thee eate graſse like the oxen.</hi> That ſome me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thinke that <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> was tranſformed into a beaſt, it is to great an abſurdity. Therefore we néede not to imagine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch <hi>metamorphoſis:</hi> but that he was ſo caſt forth of mans company, that except onely mans ſhape, he differed nothing from brute beaſtes. Yea there came ſuch a defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity vpon hym in that exile, that he was horrible to looke vpon: as we ſhall ſée afterward, that all the heares of hys body did grow as the fethers grow vpon the Egles, and hys nayles did grow like birdes clawes. Thys had he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wyth the beaſtes and birdes: in the reſt he was lyke a man. For we know not whether God did ſtrike this kyng with madnes, ſo that he ranne away and hid hymſelfe for a ſpace, or whether he were caſt forth by tumult and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy of hys nobles, or by the conſent of the whole people. Thys we do not know, becauſe the hiſtories of thoſe times are vnknowen vnto vs.</p>
                     <p>Now, whether he were enraged, and ſo ranne forth of
<pb facs="tcp:7787:73"/> mans company, or he were caſt forth as tyrantes are many times, or not: this example is very notable, that he remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with beaſtes for a ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Yet is it probable that he was ſo beſide hymſelfe, that God yet left hym the forme of man and tooke away his reaſon, as ſhall better appeare by the texte.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They ſhall cast thee forth of mans company, and thy dwelling ſhall be wyth wilde beastes, and they ſhall make thee eate graſſe like the bullockes.</hi> That is to ſay, thou ſhalt be depriued of all thy princely delicates, yea of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diet of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare people, thou ſhalt haue none other meat then brute beaſtes haue. <hi>And ſeuen tymes ſhall paſse ouer thee.</hi> Of thys we haue ſpoken before. Some do reſtreine it to vij. dayes, which neither hath reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor colour. Neither do I expound it of monethes, for that had bene a ſhort tyme. Wherefore their ſentence is more probable which do extend it to ſeuen yeares. For if <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> were caſt forth by any tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, he could not be ſo ſhortly called in agayne. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, becauſe that God would ſhew in his perſon an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce whereof might continue many ages, I doubt not but that he was ſeperated from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtate of men for a long ſeaſon. If it had bene but for ſeuen dayes or monthes, we ſée how little Gods iudgementes, vnles they be ſeuere, are regarded in the world. Wherefore, that God myght print thys puniſhment in the hartes of all, he continueth it for a long ſpace: I do not ſay vij. yeares pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciſely, for (as I ſayd) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> certaine number is put for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, but I do ſay that it was a long ſpace.</p>

                        <hi>Seuen yeares</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>ſhall paſſe ouer thee, whiles that thou know that the moſt high is the ruler in the kingdome of men.</hi> This is the ende of the puniſhment. Wherein we note, that God doth mitigate the bitternes of the payne, becauſe he doth limite it vnto a certaine tyme, and alſo had his ende determined that <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> ſhould repent in the end, becauſe hee could none other wayes waxe wiſe but by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, as the prouerbe is of the fooliſh. So was it of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie that kyng <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> muſt bee compelled by
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7787:73"/> ſcourges to ſubmit him ſelfe vnto God, becauſe nothyng could be done with him by admonitions, neither yet before by heauenly viſions. God dealeth not thus with all. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we haue here a ſpeciall example of hys clemency and mercy, which cauſed that this puniſhment which was layd vpon <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> tooke place and was profitable. The reprobate do more and more harden their hartes agaynſt God, yea they are more and more enraged and waxe furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. That <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> was chaſtened for a ſpace by the hand of God and afterward repented, to perceiue that God beareth the whole rule in all the world, this was of ſpeciall grace.</p>
                     <p>He ſayth, that God is the ruler in the kyngdome of men: becauſe that tyrauntes will be perſuaded of nothyng more hardly then that they are vnder the power of God. They will confeſſe in one word that they reigne by his grace, but in the meane ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſuppoſe that they are come to their authoritie either by their power or by fortune, and that they are mainteined therein either by their power, their wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or by their riches. Wherfore they ſhut forth (as much as in them lyeth) God from the gouernement of the world, whiles they are puffed vp with this fonde opinion, that they remaine in their ſtate and dignitie by their own power or wiſedome.</p>
                     <p>This was no ſmall profite then, that <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> began to perceiue that God is the gouernour in the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of men: for the kyngs would ſet him in a meane ſtate, betwixt them and the people. They graunt in dede that the people muſt be in obedience vnto God: but they thinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to be exempted from the common order, and they imagine after their luſtes, that they haue a priuiledge that they nede not to be vnder the hand &amp; gouernment of God. So was this (as I haue ſayd) no vulgare nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon leſſon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> learned at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt, that God doth raigne in the earth. For kyngs do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ſhut him vp in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and imagine that he doth content him with hys owne glory, ſo that he doth not intermedle with mens matters.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:7787:74"/>
                     <p>Afterward hee addeth what kinde of gouernment God hath, euen that he raiſeth vp whom he pleaſeth and caſteth downe others. God is not the gouernour then onely in this reſpect, that he ſuſteineth the world by his vniuerſall proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: but becauſe no man commeth to any authoritie but at his pleaſure. He gyrdeth ſome with a gyrdle, he vngyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth others: he powreth contempt vpon Princes and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the mighty weake, as it is written in the booke of <hi>Iob.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iob. 12.18</note> We may not imagine then any power of God that is idle, but we muſt ioyne it with the preſent acte. Whether then that tyrauntes haue the gouernment, or good and godly kynges, altogether is gouerned by the ſecret counſaile of God: for other wayes he could not be the kyng and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the world.</p>

                     <p>For as much as <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> ſayth that hée lift vp his eyes vnto heauen, and his vnderſtandyng was geuen him agayne, hereby we gather that he was a ſpace without his minde. Neither yet was he ſo without his minde, in my iudgement, but he knew his miſerie: but in the meane ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he dyd byte the bridle, and was like a brayneſéeke man. Other ſay that he was altogether mad. I will not contend of this matter: but this is ſufficient for me, that he was without his minde, ſo that he had ſome part of a beaſt. But it is probable that he had ſome intelligence left, that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued ſome puniſhment by his miſerie. In the meane ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he did not lift vp his eyes into heauen vntill God drew him to him. For the rods of God do nothyng profite vs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he worke within vs by his ſpirite, as we ſayd before.</p>
                     <p>The ſpeach is as much as if he ſhould ſay: he began to thinke that God was a iuſt iudge. For although his ſhame did trouble him for a while, yet he did not looke vnto the hand of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſmiter, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as is ſayd in an other place. Therfore he bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to acknowledge that God is the reuenger of pride, after that tyme which was appointed before was paſt, of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which we haue ſpoken. And they do lift their eyes into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen which do alſo caſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe to the earth.

                     <p>This chaungyng doth ſhew that the puniſhment was layd vppon kyng <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> eſpecially for this cauſe, becauſe he ſpoyled God of hys iuſt honour. Here he doth
<pb facs="tcp:7787:76"/> deſcribe the fruite of his repentaunce. If this affection dyd ſpryng of repentaunce that <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> ſhould bleſſe God, it foloweth then that firſt hee was a ſacrilegious perſon which tooke from God hys lawfull honour, and would ſet hym ſelfe in hys place, euen as hath bene ſayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And here alſo we may learne what it is to prayſe God truly, that is, when we beyng brought to nothyng do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and determine with our ſelues, that all thinges are vnder his gouernment (and as we ſhall ſée afterward) that he is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gouernour of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; earth, that his will ſhould ſtand both for law and reaſon, and for the chief rule of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. For otherwyſe we may celebrate the prayſes of God with open mouth, but it ſhalbe a mere diſſimulation: becauſe no man can prayſe him ſincerely and purely, but he which doth aſcribe vnto hym all theſe thynges which we will ſpeake after.</p>
                     <p>And firſt <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> ſayth: <hi>becauſe his power is the euerlaſting power, and his kingdome from generation to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> In the firſt place here he confeſſeth that God is the eternall king: which is a great thing. For there is ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt thys perpetuitie the weakenes which is in men: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all the chiefe Monarches which excell with greateſt power, haue nothing ſafe or certayne, not onely becauſe they are ſubiect to the chaunges of fortune (as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane men doo commonly iudge) or rather they hang on the gouernment of God: but becauſe they fade away for the moſt part by theyr owne vanitie.

For, although it followeth that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men there is nothyng ſure or ſound where that principle is of force, that God is the euerlaſtyng kyng: yet few do ſo reaſon: becauſe all men doo graunt vnto God w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one worde a ſure and perpetuall ſtate, but in the meane ſeaſon they do not deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de into themſelues that they might earneſtly wey and conſider theyr owne weakenes, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnmindefull of theyr ſtate, they rage euen agaynſt God himſelfe. Therfore thys explication was neceſſary which is ſet forth, that is, after that <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> prayſed God becauſe his power is euerlaſtyng: he addeth of the contrary part, that all the inhabitors of the earth are repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as nothing, <hi>Kela:</hi> which ſome do thinke to be one word and take it for a thing that endeth. For <hi>Kala</hi> ſignifieth to finiſh or to fulfill, and ſome tymes it ſignifieth to conſume, wherof they thinke the name is deriued, becauſe that men are reputed in theyr owne meaſure, but God is vnmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable. But that is a hard interpretation: and this opinion is more receaued, that <hi>[He]</hi> ſhould bee put for <hi>[Aleph]:</hi> and ſo ſayth <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> that men are reputed as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before God.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore we ſée how aptly theſe two members do agrée betwixt themſelues, that is, that God is the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting king, and men are nothing. For if any thing be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo much is diminiſhed from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power and high empire of God. Therefore it followeth that Gods right can not ſtand whole, vntill all mortall men are brought to
<pb facs="tcp:7787:77"/> nothing. And although men do ſet much by them ſelues; yet <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> doth pronounce by the inſtinction of the ſpirite, that they are nothyng, that is, before God: becauſe it commeth to paſſe none otherwyſe that they ſhould extoll them ſelues ſo much, but that they are blinded in theyr owne darkenes. But when they ſhalbe drawne vnto the light, they ſhall know that they are altogether no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And what ſo euer we be, it hangeth altogether of the grace of God, which doth kéepe vs euery moment, and doth ioyne vnto vs a new ſtrength. Therefore our part is nothing els but to reſt and ſtand ſtedfaſt in God: becauſe, as ſoone as he draweth backe his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and the power of his ſpirite, we fade away. Therefore we are ſomething, that is, in the Lord God: but we are nothing in our ſelues.</p>
                     <p>Now it followeth: <hi>that God worketh according to hys will in the army of heauen, and in the dwellers vpon earth.</hi> This might ſéeme abſurde, that God is ſayd to do as he will, as though he had neither moderation, nor equity, nor rule of iuſtice. But we muſt marke that which we haue ſpoken in an other place, that men are gouerned by lawes, becauſe their willes are peruerſe, and are caryed hither and thether after their owne luſtes without meaſure: but God is a law vnto him ſelfe, becauſe his wil is moſt perfect iuſtice. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as oft as the Scripture ſetteth forth vnto vs the power of God, and doth commaunde vs to be content therewith, it doth not attribute vnto God a tyrannicall Empire, as the wicked do falſely imagine. But becauſe we do not leaue of to ſpeake agaynſt God, and do ſet our reaſon agaynſt his ſecrete counſailes, and ſo ſtriue with him as though he dyd not that iuſtly and wiſely which is not allowed of vs: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the holy ghoſt might bridle this preſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption, he doth pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that God doth all things after his owne will.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7787:77" rendition="simple:additions"/> and obiect this or that agaynſt God.

                     <p>Now then we ſée that the world is ſo gouerned by the ſecrete prouidence of God, that nothyng commeth to paſſe but that which he hath commaunded and decréed: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore that hee ſhould alſo worthily be counted the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all thynges. Where ſome do obiect a kinde of abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, that God is therfore the author of ſinne if nothing be but by his will, yea if he worke it: this cauillation is eaſily put away, becauſe there is a diuerſitie betwixt the doing of God and the workyng of men. For when any man ſinneth, God after his maner doth worke there: but in the meane ſeaſon he farre differreth from man, becauſe he exerciſeth his iudgement: euen as he is ſayd to blinde and to harden. When then God doth commaunde the reprobate or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil, thoſe doth he geue vp to be caſt into all kindes of luſtes. When God then doth ſo, he doth exerciſe his iudgementes.
<pb facs="tcp:7787:78"/> And he which ſinneth is worthely giltie, neither can he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gle God in the ſocietie of his wickednes. Why? For God hath nothyng common with him as concernyng the action of ſinne. Therefore we ſee that theſe thynges which many would haue to diſagrée betwixt them ſelues, do well agrée, that is, that God doth rule by his will what ſoeuer is done in the world, and yet he is not the author of ſinne. Why? For he ſo vſeth the deuill and all the reprobate, that he is alway a iuſt iudge. The cauſe doth not alway appeare vnto vs, but we muſt marke this principle: becauſe that with God is all power, therfore it is not right to ſpeake agaynſt his iudgements, what ſhew of abſurditie ſoeuer they haue. And therfore it foloweth in the text: <hi>There is none that can stay his hand, or can ſay vnto him why haſt thou thus done?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> ſayth that the hand of God can not be ſtayed, hereby he derideth the madnes of men which yet do not doubt to riſe agaynſt God. Now let them lift vp their finger if they can, to ſtay his hand: and yet beyng o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome of their infirmitie they go forward in that their rage. Therfore <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> doth worthely ſhew their fooliſh madnes, whiles they lift vp them ſelues ſo preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, that they would put God to ſilence or ſhut him vp in their cages, or make ſome chaynes wherby they may binde hym. Seyng then that men do burſt forth into ſuch outragious fury, they are worthily laughed at. And hereto belong the wordes which we read in <hi>Daniel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Afterward he addeth, that none ſayth: <hi>VVhy hast thou done ſo?</hi> We know that mens tounges are loſed to all wickednes of talke, becauſe ſcarce y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth part of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth conteine them ſelues in this ſobrietie, to geue the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnto God, and to confeſſe that he is iuſt in hys workes. But here <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> did not looke what men were wont to do, but what was lawfull. Therfore he ſayth that God can not be corrected, that is, by right: ſeyng how ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the reprobate do talke, yet their vayne talkyng doth fall by it ſelfe, becauſe it hath no ground neither yet any colour. The ſumme is that the will of God ſhould be a law vnto
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7787:78" rendition="simple:additions"/> vs, becauſe we ſtriue agaynſt him in vayne: and further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more becauſe, if we permit vnto our ſelues ſo much luſt, &amp; if our madnes alſo do bruſt forth ſo farre that we will braul with God, this ſhalbe without ſucceſſe. For God hym ſelfe ſhalbe iuſtified in his iudgements and ſo all mens mouthes ſhalbe ſtopped. This is the ſumme. But we muſt marke that which is added: <hi>That the will of God is done as well in the army of heauen as in the dwellers of the earth.</hi> By the army of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I do not vnderſtand as in other places, the Sunne, the Moone, the Starres, but the Angels themſelues, and euen the very deuils, which may well be called heauenly in reſpect of their begynning: and furthermore we know that they be the Princes of the ayre. Therfore ſignifieth <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> as well the Angels as deuils and men to be gouerned by his will: and although the wicked do ruſh out neuer ſo outragiouſly, yet they are held in by a ſecrete bridle, that they can not fulfill what ſoeuer they luſt. Therfore is God ſayd to worke as well in the army of heauen as in men, what ſoeuer he will, becauſe he hath the Angels obedient vnto him, that is, the elect: but the deuils are compelled to obey his rule, although they would do the contrary. We know that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuils are by all meanes agaynſt God, but yet at the length they are compelled to obey him, not willyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but by conſtraint. And euen as he dealeth with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and deuils, ſo alſo he doth with the dwellers on earth. For ſome doth he gouerne with his ſpirite, that is, the elect: which after that they be regenerate by his ſpirite, are ſo led of him, that his righteouſnes doth truly ſhyne forth in all their workes. He worketh alſo in the reprobate, but after an other ſort: for he draweth them headlong by the hand of the deuill, he driueth them by his ſecret power, he ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them with the ſpirite of brayneſéekenes, he blyndeth them and caſteth them into a reprobate ſenſe, he hardeneth alſo their hartes to ſtubbornes. Behold how God doth worke all thinges by his will in men and Angels.</p>
                     <p>Now, there is an other kinde of working for as much as belongeth to the outward ſtate. For God doth lift this man
<pb facs="tcp:7787:79"/> on high, and caſteth downe an other. So we ſée that rich me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> often tymes become poore, and ſome are lift vp from the donghill to clime to high degrées of honor. The prophane men do call it the play of fortune, but it is the incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and moſt iuſt moderation of the prouidence of God. Thus God worketh then after his will in men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. But that inward action ſhould be put in the firſt place, as we haue ſayd.</p>

Wherfore that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie was ſo horrible that the reſtoryng might be called as it were a new creation: and therfore <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> doth ſo much celebrate this grace of God not without cauſe.

                     <p>We will not ſay that thys was done of them of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: for God ſo vſed them that yet they knew not that they did execute that which he determined.

                  <div type="meditation">
                     <p>This is the end of the commaundement: where <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezer</hi> doth ioyne a notable confeſſion of his fault with the prayſes of God. For that which he doth adde of the proud, he doth vndoubtedly properly apply to hys own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: as though he ſhould ſay, God would ſet me forth as a notable example, whereby all might know that the proud are humbled by his hand. For I was puffed vp wyth pride: but God hath thus corrected me by an horrible puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that now my example might profit all men. Therefore haue I ſayd that the king <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> did not thanke God here ſimply, but did alſo confeſſe hys fault, becauſe he was worthely brought by ſuch ſeuerity into ſubiection: for hys
<pb facs="tcp:7787:80"/> arrogancy coulde by no lighter remedy be corrected.</p>
                     <p>But firſt he ſayth: <hi>I prayſe, extoll, and glorifie the king of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi> There is no doubt but this heape of wordes came of a vehement affection. And here alſo the <hi>antetheſis</hi> muſt be vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by that principle which we haue ſene before, that is, that God is neuer rightly prayſed vntill the ſhame of men be vncouered: that God is neuer rightly extolled but when their highnes is throwne downe: that God is neuer glorified but when men being as it were ouerwhelmed wyth ſhame, fall downe vpon the earth. Therefore alſo whyles <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> doth in thys place prayſe, extoll, and glorifie God: he doth alſo confeſſe, as before, that both he and all mortall men are nothing, do deſerue no prayſe, but are worthy of all ſhame.</p>
                     <p>Afterward he addeth: <hi>becauſe all hys workes are truth.</hi> Here <hi>[Keſot]</hi> is taken for righteouſnes and integrity. For <hi>[emez dine]</hi> are called true iudgementes: but it is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to equity: therefore <hi>all the workes of God are verity,</hi> that is, they be vpright: as though he ſhould ſay, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng is worthy to be reprehended in the workes of God. Therefore the explication foloweth, that all hys wayes are iudgement. We ſée therefore that here is prayſed in God perfect iuſtice. This ought to be alſo referred vnto <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezer:</hi> as though he ſhould ſay, God did not handle me ouer roughly, there is no cauſe why I ſhould finde fault wyth hym, or murmure agaynſt hym as though he hath bene ouer ſeuere agaynſt me. Therefore I confeſſe what puniſhment ſoeuer I ſuſtayne, I was worthy of it. Why? <hi>For all the wayes of the Lord are iudgement:</hi> that is, there is great vprightnes in them. Furthermore, all his workes are truth, that is, there is no vnequall thing found in them, neyther any deceitfull thyng: but great righteouſnes ſhall ſhine in them euery where.</p>
                     <p>We ſée then how <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> doth condemne hym ſelf by hys owne mouth with theſe words, whiles he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the righteouſnes of God in all hys workes. Neyther doth thys generality hinder, that <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> ſhould
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7787:80"/> not ſet hymſelfe gilty openly and fréely before the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſeat of God: but this word hath more hehemency, whiles he beyng admoniſhed by hys owne example, doth confeſſe vniuerſally that God is iuſt, and whatſoeuer he doth is right and true. And thys poynt is worthy to be noted. For many can eaſely prayſe Gods iuſtice and equity when they haue all thinges at their owne hartes deſire: but if God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne once to deale ſharply with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then poure they forth their poyſon, and beginne to quarell wyth God and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe hym of iniuſtice and cruelty. Wherefore in that that <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> doth here co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe without exception, that God is iuſt and true in all hys workes when as he was ſo ſeuerely puniſhed, this confeſſion is not fayned: for that which he ſpeaketh muſt néedes come forth of the inward and liuely féeling of the hart, becauſe he had taſted the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of Gods iudgement.</p>
                     <p>Now in the end is added: <hi>That he can humble them that walke in pride.</hi> Here <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> doth diſcloſe hys owne ſinne and ſhame more plainly, and he is not aſhamed to confeſſe hys fault before the whole world, ſeyng that the puniſhment was euident. Wherefore like as God would haue hys madnes to be deteſted of all men when he execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch a terrible example of ſo horrible a puniſhment vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hym: ſo doth <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> now come forth and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie that he did worthely ſuffer this ſo greuous puniſhment becauſe in déede he was to proud. And here do we ſée the power of God ioyned with hys iuſtice, as was ſayd before. He doth not attribute vnto God any Tyranny that ſhould be lawles. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> hath confeſſed all the wayes of God to be iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſtraight wayes after he ſaith of himſelfe, that he was proud. Wherfore he doubteth not to ſet forth his ſhame before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he might glorify God. And thys is the right way to prayſe God, not onely when we confeſſe our ſelues to be nothyng, but alſo when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count our vices: agayne when we do not onely knowledge wythin our ſelues and in our owne conſciences that we are wicked and worthy to be condemned before God, but
<pb facs="tcp:7787:81"/> teſtify the ſame wyth open mouth before all mortall men ſo oft as ſhall be neceſſary. And when the word of humilitation or humbling is named, it is to be referred to that outward abbaſing and caſting downe when God caſt <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezer</hi> forth into the woodes to liue among the wilde beaſts. Howbeit he was alſo humbled after an other ſort, euen as one of the children of God.</p>
                     <p>Seyng then there be two kindes of humiliation, <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezer</hi> ſpeaketh of the firſt, where God doth caſt down and deface y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proud. Thys is one kynde of humbling, which hath no fruit vnleſſe the Lord do afterward gouerne vs wyth hys ſpirit of humility. Thus <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> doth not here comprehend the grace of God, which yet ſhould haue had the chiefe prayſe: neither yet doth he deſcribe in thys decrée whatſoeuer were to be required of a godly man that had bene long exerciſed in the ſchole of God: but yet he maketh it manifeſt that he had much profited vnder Gods corrections, when he attributeth vnto hym the moſt high power, and ioyneth thereunto the commendation of iuſtice and equity.</p>

In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt place we muſt note the tyme in the which <hi>Beltſazar</hi> did celebrate thys feaſt. Now the ſeuenty yeares were paſſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that tyme that <hi>Daniel</hi> was brought into exile.

And this is probable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough. Although it ſéemeth that <hi>Methaſthenes</hi> erred in this that he made diuerſe kinges, ſeyng they were onely diuerſe names. For <hi>Herodotus</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Herodot. Lib. <hi>1.</hi>
                        </note> doth not call thys king of whom now me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion is made, <hi>Beltſazar:</hi> but calleth hys father <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binetus,</hi> &amp; hym alſo by the ſame name.

For when we ſpeake of the ſeuenty yeares wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Ieremy</hi> did prophecy, we may not beginne at the captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Daniel.,</hi> neyther at the deſtruction of the Citie: but at that miſerable deſtruction which came betwixt the firſt vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of king <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> (which he had whiles hys fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was aliue) and the burning and vtter ruine of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the Citie.

                     <p>Therefore that we may finde the ſeuenty yeares in the which God would end the captiuity of hys people, it ſhalbe neceſſary to prolong the raigne of <hi>Euilmerodah</hi> longer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thrée and twenty yeares: Although there is no great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in that matter. For a little after <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned and caried away the king, although he left the Citie ſtanding. And though the temple did ſtand ſtill at that tyme, yet God had layd a moſt greuous plague vpon the people, which was almoſt as euill as the laſt deſtruction. Howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it is, we ſée that <hi>Beltſazar</hi> doth celebrate this feaſt when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme of deliueraunce was now at hand. And here is the prouidence of God to be conſidered, which ruleth the houres and tymes, that the wicked whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the time is ripe for
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7787:82"/> their fall, caſt themſelues downe hedlong. So chaunced it to this wicked kyng.</p>
                     <p>It was a meruelous madnes and blindnes that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared ſo great a feaſt full of delicates, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the Citie was yet beſieged. For <hi>Cyrus</hi> had now a long tyme beſieged the Citie wyth a great army, &amp; thys miſerable king was halfe ſurpriſed: yet notwithſtanding as it were in deſpight of God, he maketh a dainty feaſt and calleth a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d geſtes. Hereby may we eaſily coniecture what buſines there was &amp; what charges in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feaſt. For if one would intertaine but eyther ten or twenty men, there will be much buſines and trauayle if ſo be he wyll treate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſumptuouſly. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there was preparation made for the Prince, when there were a thouſand noble perſonages, the Quéene and the kinges concubines, when ſo great a multitude was then gathered together: no doubt there muſt néedes be much ſearching out of many partes, to finde ſufficient delicates: and thys thing may ſéeme increadible. But <hi>Xenophon,</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he tell many fables, and do neither kéepe the graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nor fidelity of an hiſtoriographer becauſe he wil ſet forth the prayſes of <hi>Syrus</hi> like and orator: yet in thys poynt there is no cauſe why he ſhould lie) ſayth that there was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of vitayle layd vp in ſtore that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Babylonians</hi> might beare the ſiege ten yeare more. And <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        </hi> may worthely be called a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey. For the greatnes of that City was ſuch that is is incredible to be tolde. Doubtles it muſt néedes be that is was very full of people. And ſeyng they caried vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes from all <hi>Aſai</hi> thether, it is no meruaile if the men of <hi>Babell</hi> had vitaile layd vp in ſtore, that they myght ſuſtaine themſelues a long ſpace, the gates being ſhut vp.</p>
                     <p>But thys is wonderfull, that the king which ſhould haue watched hymſelfe, or at the leaſt haue ſent forth hys watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men leſt the Citie ſhould bee taken, gaue hymſelfe to ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keting and to pleaſure, as though he were in great peace, and were in no daunger of the outward enemy. He had to do wyth <hi>Cyrus</hi> a ſtout man, if there were euer any: who alſo not onely excelled in wiſdome, but alſo in actiuitie far
<pb facs="tcp:7787:83"/> paſſed all other. Seing then he was ſo mightely aſſaulted, it is meruaile that he was ſo careles to geue himſelfe to fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and banketyng. <hi>Xenophon</hi> ſayth, that that day was a feaſt day. Wheras the Iewes thinke that the victory was gotten of the <hi>Chaldeis</hi> agaynſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> that is a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle. For <hi>Xenophon,</hi> whom we may beleue in thys matter when hee doth not lye in the fauour of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> for then he is a moſt graue author and a witnes worthy to bee bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: but when he wyll prayſe <hi>Cyrus</hi> there is no end: in thys point is an hiſtoriographer, when he ſaith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thys was euery yeare a feaſtiuall day and a ſolemne feaſt wyth the <hi>Babilonians.</hi> He ſheweth alſo how <hi>Babylon</hi> was taken: that is, <hi>Gobria</hi> and <hi>Gabatha</hi> beyng captaynes. For thys <hi>Beltſazar</hi> had gelded the one to put hym to ſhame, and had killed the ſonne of the other, the father beyng yet aliue. Therefore when the one did burne wyth the deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengement for the death of hys ſonne, and the other for the ſhame that he had done vnto hym, they both conſpired to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. So it came to paſſe that <hi>Cyrus</hi> turned away many riuers of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and ſo <hi>Babylon</hi> was ſodenly taken.</p>
                     <p>We muſt alſo note, that <hi>Babylon</hi> was twiſe taken: or els the prophecies ſhould not be beleued. For whereas the Prophetes threaten to the <hi>Babylonians</hi> the vengeaunce of God,<note place="margin">Ierem. 50.</note> they ſay that their enemies ſhould be moſt cruel, which ſhould not ſéeke golde or ſiluer, but ſhould deſire mens bloud. Furthermore they ſpeake of the moſt horrible actes which were wont to bee committed in battayle. But no ſuch thing came to paſſe when <hi>Babylon</hi> wan taken of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi> But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Babylonians</hi> caſting of the yoke had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered themſelues from the dominion of the <hi>Perſians, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> recouered the Citie: which was wrought by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meanes of <hi>Zopirus,</hi> who maymed his body, and fayned that he was ſo cruelly handled of the kyng, that he myght betray the Citie. How ſore the <hi>Babylonians</hi> were then afflicted, we may gather in that he crucified thrée thouſand of the nobles. What was done among the common people, when thoſe thrée thouſand nobles were deſtroyed and all were hanged
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7787:83"/> on the gallowes, yea euen crucified? Hereby then it playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeareth that the puniſhment was reſerued for the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians</hi> vntill that tyme, although in the meane ſeaſon they were ſubiect to a ſtraunge power, and were reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully handled of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> that is, brought to bongade and ſlauery, for they were forbidden to were weapons, and they were taught of <hi>Cyrus</hi> euen the firſt day to ſerue, ſo that they durſt not cary a ſword.</p>
                     <p>It is nedefull to touch theſe thinges briefly, that we may know that mens affayres are ſo gouerned by the ſecrete iudgement of God, that he caſteth downe the reprobate when their puniſhment is neare them. Of the which thing we haue here a notable example in the king <hi>Beltſazar.</hi> The tyme of the deliueraunce which was ſpoken of by <hi>Ieremy</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ierem. 25.</note> was come, the <hi>70.</hi> yeares were ended, <hi>Babylon</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged. Now the Iewes might lift vp their heades, and hope well, becauſe the comming of <hi>Cyrus</hi> chaunced aboue all mens opinion. For he ruſhed in ſodainly from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of <hi>Perſia,</hi> when that nation was barbarous. Seing then that <hi>Cyrus</hi> came ſodainly lyke a whirle winde, thys alteration myght geue ſome hope to the <hi>Iewes.</hi> But when he did lie long in vayne (that I myght ſo ſpeake) in beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Citie, this myght diſcorage their myndes.</p>
                     <p>Now when <hi>Beltſazar</hi> did banket wyth hys nobles, he thought that he could caſt <hi>Cyrus</hi> forth by play and ſport, as they ſay. But in the meane ſeaſon the Lord did not ſit idle in heauen. For he ſo blindeth the minde of the wicked king, that he wyllingly goeth forth to hys owne puniſhment, and although no man draw hym, he offereth hymſelfe. How is thys, but becauſe God had geuen hym vp to hys enemy? according to the decrée whereof <hi>Ieremy</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ierem. 25.</note> ſpeaketh. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although <hi>Daniel</hi> tell the hiſtory, yet it is our part (as I haue ſayd) to weigh farre greater thynges: that is, that God which had promiſed a deliueraunce to hys people, ſhould now put forth his hand out of the ſecret, and ſhould fulfill that which was prophecied of by the Prophetes.</p>
                     <p>Now it foloweth, that kyng <hi>Betſazar</hi> did drinke wyne
<pb facs="tcp:7787:84"/> before a thouſand. Where as one of the <hi>Hebrue</hi> Doctours ſayth that he ſtroue with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d nobles, ſo that he was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with them all in the intemperancie of drinkyng, that is ouer groſſe. For as much then as he ſayth that he dyd drinke wyne before a thouſand, he had reſpect to the maner of the nation. For this was a rare thyng, that the <hi>Chaldey</hi> kynges ſhould receiue any to their table. For they were wont to banket ſo alone, as the kynges of <hi>Europe</hi> do now: and they thinke it belongeth to their dignitie, to haue a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prepared for one alone. Such was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pride of the kinges of <hi>Chaldey.</hi> Seyng then it is ſayd, <hi>that Beltſazar did drinke wyne before a thouſand:</hi> ſome extraordinary thyng was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that in dede he celebrated a ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne feaſt and did, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his dayly maner, geue his nobles ſo great honour, that he did receiue them to his table. Neither is that very credible which ſome do coniecture, that he dranke wyne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, becauſe he was wont to be dronken without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. But this word <hi>before,</hi> is taken for communication or ſocietie.</p>

This did <hi>Beltſazar.</hi> His ſecuritie
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7787:84"/> and careleſnes was a ſigne of aſtoniſhment: and this was a token of the wrath of God, when he could be ſo careleſly geuen to pleaſure in his aduerſitie and in the mids of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils: but this excecation doth more clearely ſhew forth the vengeance of God, that he not beyng content with hys in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperancie in feaſtyng and bankettyng without all regard of the tyme, doth euen make battaile openly agaynſt God.

                     </p>
                     <p>It appeareth that thoſe veſſels were layd vp in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.

Neither is there any doubt but that he commaunded thoſe veſſels to be brought forth in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion, that he might triumph agayne ouer the true God, as we ſhall ſée afterward. Whereas y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet calleth <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezer</hi> the father of kyng <hi>Beltſazar,</hi> we haue now expounded in what ſenſe it ſhould be taken: becauſe it is a common thyng that as well the grandfathers as the great grandfathers and fathers of the great grandfathers are called fathers. Therfore becauſe <hi>Beltſazar</hi> did come of the ſéede of <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> and was of his iſhue, therfore is he called his ſonne: wherof we ſhall ſée more agayne here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. There be ſome alſo which thinke that <hi>Euilmerodah</hi> was ſtricken with that greuous plague which was rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the chapter before. And it may be that he was called <hi>Nebuchadnezer:</hi> but there is no neceſſitie to moue vs ſo to thinke. For this was to vayne when the name of father was mencioned, ſtraight way to flye to that coniecture.</p>
                     <p>The Prophet ſayth that <hi>Beltſazar</hi> dyd commaund this in the taſting of the wine. Becauſe <hi>[taam]</hi> ſignifieth to taſt, there is no doubt but he ſpeaketh here of taſtyng. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is metaphorically tranſfered to vnderſtandyng, therefore certaine do expound, that he was forced by the wyne, and ſo in ſtead of reaſon and iudgement, he was led

                        </note> Night, loue, and wine do perſuade no moderate thyng. But that expoſition doth ſeme vnto me ouermuch forced. Therfore I take it ſimply, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Belt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſazar</hi> was warme with wine, he commaunded the veſſels to be brought vnto him: and this is more receaued. When the taſt of the wine dyd ouercome, that is, when wine had oppreſſed the kynges ſenſes, then he commaunded the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to be brought vnto him. And this is worthy to be noted, that we may learne to beware of all intemperatenes of drinke: becauſe nothyng is more eaſie then to take in hand many thinges raſhly as ſoone as the taſte of wine hath trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled our ſenſes. Therfore we muſt vſe wine ſoberly that it may ſtrenghten, not onely the body, but alſo quicken the mynde and all the ſenſes, and not debilitate and weaken the body, much leſſe aſtoniſh the ſenſes. And this is now ouer much vſuall, as it was alſo noted in the old prouerbes, that pride commeth of dronkennes. Therefore the Poetes dyd fayne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

                     <p>Here the Prophet doth ſhew more clearely and diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the kyng did then deride the true &amp; onely God, when
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7787:85"/> he commaunded the veſſels to be brought vnto him. For when they were brought: <hi>they prayſed</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>all theyr golden and ſiluer Gods:</hi> that is, they celebrated the prayſes of the falſe Gods in the reproch of the true God, as though they would thanke them, as alſo <hi>Habacuc</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Habac. 1.</note> ſayth. Albeit there is no doubt but they ſacrificed to their power, to their ſtrength, as the Prophet ſayth in the ſame place: but they ſet vp their Gods to that intent that they might ouerthrow the glory of the true God. And this is alſo the reaſon wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prophet doth now playnely tell, that thoſe veſſels were brought out of the temple of the houſe of the Lord. For here he doth exaggerate the wickednes of the king and his nobles, that they did lift vp their hornes agaynſt the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Therfore this <hi>antitheſis</hi> is to be noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God which commaunded that they ſhould built him a temple in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> &amp; that ſacrifices ſhould be offered, and betwixt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> falſe Gods.

                     <p>
                        <hi>They dranke</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>wyne, and prayſed their Gods.</hi> The Prophet doth not here aſcribe it to dronkenes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Gods, but yet hee teacheth by the way that this wickednes was more kindled with drinke. For if euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had bene ſober at his owne houſe, they would not haue ſo ſtubbornly riſen vp agaynſt God. But ſeyng that wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes reigned in their hartes, thereunto came alſo intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratenes in drinke, as bellowes to blowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fire. This doth the Prophet ſéeme vnto me to note when he repeteth, <hi>that they dranke.</hi> For he ſayd: <hi>The king and the nobles, his wife and concubines dyd drinke.</hi> Now doth he inculcate the ſame thing
<pb facs="tcp:7787:86"/> agayne almoſt with like wordes, <hi>that they dranke:</hi> but hée addeth, <hi>that they dranke wyne:</hi> as though he ſhould ſay, theyr madnes was more kindled when they were ſtirred vp with the heate of the wyne.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>dyd they prayſe the ſiluer Gods &amp;c.</hi> The Prophet doth reprochfully ſpeake here of the Gods of gold, ſiluer, braſſe, wood, and of ſtone, becauſe we knew that God hath no affinitie with gold or ſiluer. Therfore his true Image ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be expreſſed in corruptible matter. This is the reaſon wherefore the Prophet doth ſay here that all the Gods which the <hi>Babylonians</hi> worſhipped, were of gold, ſiluer, braſſe, wood and ſtone. Doubtles the prophane men were neuer ſo doltiſh, that they thought the eſſence and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce of God to be of gold, ſiluer, or ſtone: they ſo called onely the images of the Gods. But becauſe they imagined in their opinion that the power and Maieſtie of God was alwayes ſhut vp vnderſtone, wood, gold and ſiluer, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes do worthely thus condemne their doltiſh groſſenes. For we know how diligently the Idolaters do deuiſe all the ſhiftes they can, to flye vnto: and at this day the Popedome is a document cleare enough that the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious neuer want their excuſes, which they pretend when they will excuſe their errours. Therfore the Prophet doth not here admit thoſe vayne pretenſes, wherby the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> and ſuch like did colour their ſhame: but hee ſayth that their Gods were gold and ſiluer. Wherfore? For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they dyd confeſſe with their mouth that the Gods reigned in heauen (for ſuch a multitude and rable of Gods was receiued amongeſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the Maieſty of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very true God was, as it were wrapped in darkenes) although, I ſay, the <hi>Babylonians</hi> dyd confeſſe that the Gods dwelt in heauen, yet did they flye to Images and pictures.

                     <p>And whereas he ſayth: <hi>that the veſſels were then brought away,</hi> hereby it appeareth how ſeruauntes do obey tyrants in the moſt wicked thinges: for without any delay ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7787:86"/> the veſſels were brought forth of the treaſures. <hi>Daniel</hi> therfore ſignifieth that all his ſeruauntes were ready at this commaundement, that they might pleaſe this beaſtly dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard.

Yet did he not vnderſtand what it ſhould be: for God did but onely ſhew a ſigne, as it were of ſome euill lucke, as the prophane men were wont to ſpeake. Thererfore God did by this meanes beginne the pageant, when he ſaw the king ſo feruent in all outragious diſſolutenes with his nobles. Therefore ſayth the propphet: <hi>there appeared the hand of a man.</hi> He calleth it the hand of a man becauſe of the likenes or faſhion. For it is certayne that it was not the hand of a man: but becauſe it did reſemble a hand, therefore is it cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a mans hand. And the ſcripture alſo ſpeaketh after this maner often times, eſpecially where there is any mention of the outward ſacramentes. Therefore this is alſo a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall kinde of ſpeach (that I might ſo ſpeake). For God hym ſelfe dyd write by his power, but he ſhewed the figure to king <hi>Beltſazar,</hi> as though ſome man dyd write in the wall. Therefore, <hi>the fingers of a hand went forth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When he ſayth, <hi>that the fingers went forth,</hi> thys ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth much for the certayntie of the miracle. For except <hi>Beltſazar</hi> had ſeene thys beginning, he might haue coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured that that hand was ſet there by ſome arte. But wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the wall was wythout that forme before, and alſo the hand came forth ſodeinly: hereby one may eaſily gather that that hand was a heauenly ſigne, whereby God would
<pb facs="tcp:7787:87"/> ſhew ſome great thing to the king. Therefore, ſayth he, <hi>the fingers of a hand came forth ouer agaynst the candelsticke,</hi> or the light. It is certayne that this was a night banket: and <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        </hi> was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo at midnight. Neither was it any meruaile that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feaſt was continued long. For intemperan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy hath no meaſure: and moreouer they were ſo wont to ryot. I confeſſe, they dyd not feaſte euery day till midnight: but when they celebrated ſome gorgious and daynty feaſt, they thought that theyr myrth ſhould not be long enough, except they ſhould as it were rotte and putrify at the table (that I might ſo ſpeake). So then ouer agaynſt the candel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke there appeared a hand, whereby it might be the more euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly ſéene. And that hand dyd write (ſayth the prophet) vpon the plaſter of the wall in the palace.</p>
                     <p>If any man ſhould haue tolde the king that there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the forme of a mans hand, thys might haue bene doubted. But he ſayth that the king dyd ſée it him ſelfe, For God would terrify him, as we ſhall ſée afterward: therefore dyd he ſet before hym ſuch a ſpectacle. The king then ſaw: peraduenture not the nobles: &amp; we ſhall ſée after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king was only ſmitte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with feare, ſauing that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to tremble with him. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſaw hys face changed, and that he was ouercome with ſorrow, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan alſo to feare, although they all ſtudyed to geue ſome comforth. Therefore God would after a ſort ſommon the wicked king to his iudgement ſeat, when the hand of a man which wrote, appeared in his ſight.</p>

And it was neceſſary that he ſhould thus be ſtricken, that all men might vnderſtand, that God did ſit in hys throne as iudge, and ſommon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king as gilty. We haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before, and <hi>Daniel</hi> hath alſo declared the great pride of the king, and hys careleſſe ſecuritie hath bene a playne and cleare proofe of the ſame. For whereas the long continued ſéege ought to haue made him careful, he maketh a great feaſt, as if he had had no warre at all. Whereby it appeareth that he was ouercome with a dronkenes of mynde, that he could not féele hys owne miſeries. This was the cauſe therfore why God would waken him and rayſe hym out of his dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dreame: becauſe he could not returne neither be called home to a ſober mynde by any vſuall meanes. Now that he was thus terrified, it might ſéeme to be a good preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to repentance. But the ſame is ſet forth vnto vs in hys perſon, which is ſet forth in <hi>Eſau.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 27.34</note> For <hi>Eſau</hi> was not onely ſtricken with ſorrow when he ſaw him ſelfe refuſed, but he alſo aſked the bleſſing of hys father with great mourning and lamentation, but ouer late. The ſame is now ſet forth in king <hi>Beltſazar.</hi> But all thinges are to be noted in order.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Daniel</hi> ſayth: <hi>that the kinges countenance was changed: furthermore the ioyntes of hys loynes were looſed and he was troubled or terrified in his thoughtes.</hi> Laſt of all he addeth: <hi>that his knees ſmote one agaynſt the other:</hi> for the word doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifie to ruſh agaynſt. The prophet declareth the matter by the ſignes, that is to ſay, that the king <hi>Beltſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> was affrayd at the viſion, whereof mention was made. There is no doubt (as I ſayd before) but that he was thus terrified by Gods apoyntment. For we know that the reprobate, although God doo openly declare that he calleth them to his iudgement ſeate: yet doo they remayne ſenſeles, and are nothing affrayd. But God would ſtrike the hart of this wicked kyng, ſo that there ſhould be no excuſe of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce.</p>
                     <p>And here we may note that God doth by diuerſe meanes touch me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s harts. I ſpeake not onely of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reprobate, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the elect. For we ſée euen very good men to be ſlacke and ſlow when God doth ſommon them to his iudgement ſeat. Therfore is it neceſſary that they be compelled with chaſtiſementes, for they would neuer come willingly vnto God. He can moue their mindes without any violence: but he will ſet forth vnto vs, as it were in a glaſſe, how great our ſlownes and ſlacknes is: for we neuer obey his word but agaynſt our willes. Wherfore he bringeth downe his owne children by correction, when he doth not preuaile by his word alone. But as concernyng the reprobate, he doth ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſcloſe their contumacy. For he doth entiſe them by fayre meanes before hee take vppon him the office of a iudge: and when he preuaileth not hereby, he threatneth: and when threatnynges auayle not or can take no place, then doth he ſommon them to his iudgement ſeat.</p>
                     <p>As concernyng the kyng of <hi>Babylon,</hi> God had ſuffered <hi>Daniel</hi> to kepe ſilence. For the kyngs ingratitude and pride had ſtopped the way that <hi>Daniel</hi> could not do the office and part of a teacher, as he was willyng. The kyng of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> therfore lacked a teacher. But God ſodenly appeared as a iudge by this writyng, of the which ſome thyng is light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7787:88"/> touched, and more ſhalbe ſayd in place conuenient. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it is, we do ſée that kyng <hi>Beltſazar</hi> was not onely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed by an outward ſigne, of his deſtruction that was at hand: but that he was alſo wakened inwardly to know that he had to do with God. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reprobate do flatter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues often times, although God ſhew him ſelfe to be their iudge. But he hath dealt otherwyſe with kyng <hi>Beltſazar:</hi> for he would haue him to bee terrified that he might be the more attentiue to read the writyng. This terror (as I ſayd before) was a preparation to repentaunce: but he fayled in the mid way, as we ſée many do, which tremble at the voyce of God or at the ſignes of his vengeance as ſoone as he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſheth them: but they vaniſh away ſtraight wayes, ſo that they are not taught as they ſhould be.</p>
                     <p>Like vnto this is the example of <hi>Eſau:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 25.</note> for he deſpiſed the grace of God when he heard that hee was depriued of the heritage that was promiſed from God. He counted the bleſſing therfore but as a fable, vntill he perceaued that the matter was executed in dede: then began he to lament, but altogether in vayne. Such was the trouble of kyng <hi>Beltſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar.</hi> For as we ſhall ſée afterward, euen when <hi>Daniel</hi> did expound vnto him the writyng, yet was he nothyng moued with this matter, but adorned <hi>Daniel</hi> with royall orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. But this was for an other end and purpoſe. For whiles his nobles were moued and the thyng was made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, God by this meanes dyd declare his glory: and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> alſo which tooke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Citie with <hi>Cyrus</hi> his ſonne in law, vnderſtoode that he got not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> victory by his owne power or induſtry, neither that he was ſo holpen of the two Princes <hi>Gobria</hi> and <hi>Gabatha:</hi> but all the thyng was done by the prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God. So then doth God ſhew, as it were in a glaſſe, that he is the reuenger of hys people, as he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſeuenty yeares before.</p>

                     <p>The Prophet declareth that there was a redemy ſought of kyng <hi>Beltſazar</hi> for his ſorow.

Furthermore when the Prophet ſayth: <hi>that he cryed loude,</hi> hereby it appeareth that he was ſo aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed that he forgot that he was a kyng: for it was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greyng to his dignitie to cry ſo loude at the table. But God had ſhake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all his pride: therfore was he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to burſt forth in an outcry, as though he were a mad man.</p>
                     <p>But now let vs ſée what was his remedy. He commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> ſoothſayers, and Aſtrologians ſhould be called. Hereby we gather how ready the wits of men are to vanitie, lyes and deceites. <hi>Daniel</hi> ſhould haue bene the firſt among the <hi>Chaldeans:</hi> and that aunſwere was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be remembred when hee ſhewed to the grandfather of kyng <hi>Beltſazar</hi> before, that he ſhould be lyke the wilde beaſtes.

He was alſo dayly in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyngs ſight, yet was hee deſpiſed, and the kyng called for all the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> Aſtrologia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Sothſayers, and Mages. In déede the Sothſayers, Aſtrologia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> were in ſuch high eſtimation, that they might eaſely darken the fame of <hi>Daniel.</hi> For they counted it an vnworthy thyng that a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner ſhould be preferred before their Doctours, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they now knew that they did excell in this glory amongeſt all people, that they were onely wyſe. Seyng then they would kéepe that eſtimation that they were, as it were the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7787:89"/> of God, it is no meruell though they deſpiſed a ſtraunger. Howbeit this thyng hath no colour before God. For what can bee alledged for the defence of the wicked kyng? His grandfather was ſet forth as a ſpectacle of Gods vengeance neuer to be forgotten, when he was caſt forth of the company of men, when hee dwelt with the brute beaſtes, yea with the wilde beaſtes of the foreſt. And this could not ſeme to come by chaunce. For God had admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed hym hereof in a dreame, and alſo made his Prophet an interpreter of the oracle and viſion: wherefore the fame of this matter ought to haue bene in perpetuall remembrance amongeſt the <hi>Chaldees.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Nephue of king <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> forgetting thys example, doth rage agaynſt the God of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> doth pollute the veſſels of the temple, and maketh a triumph wyth hys Idols. But when God ſetteth forth a ſigne of his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he calleth for the <hi>Chaldees</hi> and Mages, and forgetteth <hi>Da: niel.</hi> Can thys be excuſed by any meanes? We ſée therefore that mens myndes are ouer prone to the craftes of Sathan, and this prouerbe is true: the world would be deceaued. And thys is worthy to be noted, becauſe that many men now a dayes would gladly pretend ignoraunce in the ſtead of a ſhield in doubtful matters. But they may eaſely be anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered, that they are willingly blinded, yea that they ſhut their eyes agaynſt the manifeſt light. For if God did count king <hi>Beltſazar</hi> inexcuſable becauſe he had a Prophet once offered vnto hym, what ſhall it auayle vs at thys day, to pretend theſe colourable excuſes? Oh if I knew certainely which were the will of God, I would ſtraight wayes obey. For God dayly cryeth openly and calleth vs vnto hym, and ſheweth the way, but there is none that anſwereth, or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, or at the leaſt very feawe. Therefore we ought di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to conſider the example of the kyng of <hi>Babylon,</hi> when we ſée that he is very dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; yet in the meane ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon doth not ſéeke God as he ought. Wherefore? He wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth about the buſh, he ſéeth that he is taken and that he can not eſcape Gods iudgement: but in the meane tyme he
<pb facs="tcp:7787:90" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſéeketh comfort at the Mages and <hi>Chaldees,</hi> that is to ſay, at the deceauers. For they had bene already found ſo to be once or twiſe, as we haue ſéene before: and thys ought to haue bene publiſhed and knowen vnto all.</p>
                     <p>We ſée then that king <hi>Beltſazar</hi> was blynde, becauſe he ſhut hys eyes againſt the light offered: as all the world is blind at this day almoſt, becauſe it doth not wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but when the lyght is offered it ſhutteth the eyes, as though it refuſed the grace of God, and would caſt it ſelfe downe wilfully: And this is ouer common.</p>
                     <p>Now whereas the Prophet ſayth: <hi>that the king promiſed to the wiſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that whoſeuer could read the writing ſhould haue a golden chayne: furthermore, he ſhould be clothed with purple, and ſhould be the third ruler in the kingdome:</hi> hereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was not ſincerely touched with the feare of God. And this reſiſting is worthy to be marked in the reprobate, becauſe they feare the iudgement of God, and yet in the meane ſeaſon the pride which is in their hartes is not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, but it burſteth forth: euen as we ſée in thys king: For, <hi>his knees did ſmite one an other:</hi> Furthermore, <hi>the ioyntes of his loynes were looſed:</hi> and to conclude, there was no part of hys body which did not tremble. Therefore the king was as it were dead, becauſe that feare had oppreſſed all hys ſenſes. Yet ſée we in the meane tyme a ſecret pride ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hyd in hys hart, which burſt forth afterward when he promiſed, <hi>that he ſhould be the third in hys kingdome whoſoeuer ſhould interprete the writing.</hi> God had now caſt hym downe from the dignity of a king: yet wil he ſet vp others in digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, fighting as it were agaynſt God.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture that the letters were ſet out of order, or written in an other order, or ſome put vnder other, that the word <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kel</hi> ſhould goe before, and then <hi>Mene Mene?</hi> Theſe things bee to vayne. Thys is certaine, that God would admoniſh the king of his deſtruction now at hand: alſo that his minde was troubled, not that he would repent, but that hys care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſnes ſhould be inexcuſable: and that whether he would or not he ſhould call for ſome remedy, becauſe he knew he had to do with God.</p>
                     <p>Now as concerning the writing, God ſhould not haue bene frée except it had bene in hys wyll to ſpeake ſometime with one man alone, ſometime with more. Therefore he would that king <hi>Beltſazar</hi> ſhould know thys writing. In the meane ſeaſon all the Mages, as though they had bene blynd, could not read the writing. As concerning the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, it is no meruaile if they were doubtfull in it. For God ſpake darkly whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſayth: <hi>Mene, Mene,</hi> &amp; then, <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kel,</hi> that is, <hi>weighed: <hi>Peres,</hi> it is diuided.</hi> Although thoſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7787:91"/> Mages had read theſe foure wordes an hundreth tymes, yet they could neither coniecture, nor comprehend in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon what they ment. For that was an allegoricall prophecy, vntill there was an interpreter ordayned from heauen. But foraſmuch as belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to thoſe letters, there is no meruaile though the eyes of the Mages were ſhut and cloſed vp, becauſe it pleaſed God ſo, which would ſommon the kyng to hys iudgement, as we haue ſayd.</p>
                     <p>The Prophet ſayth: <hi>that the king was astoniſhed, his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was chaunged, hys Princes were alſo troubled.</hi> The fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the iudgement of God muſt of neceſſity encreaſe, leſt the thyng ſhould haue bene hid. For (as we ſhall ſée af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward) king <hi>Beltſazar</hi> hymſelfe was ſlayne in that ſame night. <hi>Cyrus</hi> entred when the <hi>Babylonians</hi> feaſted and were careleſly geuen to their daintyes and delicates.

                     <p>Here <hi>Daniel</hi> declareth, by what occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was brought before the kyng: that he myght read and interprete the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.

But we muſt diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly note that which we may ſurely gather by the wordes of the Prophet, that is, that the kinges ingratitude is caſt him in the téeth, that he did not ſend for <hi>Daniel</hi> among the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <hi>Chaldees,</hi> and Aſtrologians.</p>
                     <p>The holy man would not be counted in that order: and he were worthy that God ſhould ſpoyle hym of his prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſpirit, if he had ioyned him ſelfe with theſe deceauers: and it eaſily appeareth that hee was ſeparated from them. The kyng <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> had made him ruler ouer all the Mages: but he would not vſe this honor, becauſe (as I haue ſayd) he ſhould haue depriued him ſelfe of the gift of prophecy. For we muſt ſée what is lawful for vs to do. We know that we are prone to nothyng more then to be drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away with the entiſementes of the world, eſpecially with ambition, which blindeth vs, and troubleth all our ſenſes: and there is no greater peſtilence.

The ſame
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7787:92"/> thyng might haue come vnto <hi>Daniel,</hi> if hee had not bene holden backe through a hartie zele of true pietie. But he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed that honour offered vnto hym of kyng <hi>Nebuchadne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer.</hi> Therfore would he neuer be counted amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Sooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayes, Aſtrologians, and ſuch lyke deceauers, which did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude that nation with their enchauntmentes. Hereof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it that now the Quéene ſayth that there is a certaine man named <hi>Daniel.</hi> But the kyng was not blameles by this pretence: becauſe (as we haue ſayd) <hi>Daniel</hi> had gotten him a famous name for many yeares, and God would note him forth with a ſure note, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s mindes ſhould be bent vpon hym as vpon an heauenly Angell. For as much then as kyng <hi>Beltſazar</hi> knew not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there was ſuch a Prophet in his kyngdome, it is the ſigne of a ſhamefull &amp; beaſtly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſnes. Therfore God would caſt this in the téeth of kyng <hi>Beltſazar</hi> by a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when ſhe ſayth: <hi>Let not thy thoughtes trouble thee.</hi> She calleth vpon him gently, becauſe ſhe ſaw hym to be afrayd: But in the meane ſeaſon ſhe ſheweth that he erreth ouer groſſely, becauſe he wandereth about the buſh and yet might ſoone come to hys purpoſe, for as much as God had geuen to his Prophet a light in his hand to lighten hym, except hee deſired willyngly to wander in darkenes, as all the reprobate do.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, we may ſée in this kyng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> common vice of all mankind, that is, that none doth runne out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way, but he which either flattereth him ſelfe in ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or els that would haue all light extinguiſhed. Now, whereas y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Quéene ſayth: <hi>That the ſpirite of the holy Gods is in Daniell,</hi> we haue declared in an other place what is men therby. For it is no marueile though prophane me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do ſpeake ſo, becauſe they are not able to diſcerne betwixt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> onely God &amp; the Angels. Wherfore they called Gods indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly what ſo euer came from God or from the heauens. Hereby it commeth then, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Quéene calleth the Angels holy Gods, &amp; in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane ſeaſon ſhe ſetteth God but amongeſt the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſort. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it is our part ſo to knowledge the onely God, that hée alone ſhould haue the préeminence: and that the very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<pb facs="tcp:7787:93"/> be brought vnder him, and that there is no excellency neither in heauen nor in earth, which can obſcure hys glory. For the Scripture laboureth to this end, to ſet God in moſt high degrée: and alſo that nothyng ſhould be of ſuch excellency which ſhould not geue place to his Maieſty. But here we ſée how neceſſary it is that we be taught of the one onely eſſence of God: becauſe from the begynnyng of the world men were alwayes perſuaded of this, that there was ſome one moſt hye power: but afterward they all vaniſhed away in their owne cogitations, ſo that they dyd forget God: &amp; moreouer did ioyne him with the Angels, ſo that all thynges were confounded.

Thus the <hi>Chaldees</hi> called the gift of vnderſtandyng or knowledge which was rare and excellent, the ſpirite of the Gods, becauſe they did know that men did not atteine nor get vnto them ſelues the gift of prophecy by their owne induſtry and diligence: but that
<pb facs="tcp:7787:95"/> this is a heauenly gift. Therefore they are compelled to geue God his prayſe. But becauſe the true God was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne vnto them, they ſpake intricatly, and (as I ſayd) they called the Angels Gods, becauſe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> darkenes of theyr ignoraunce they could not diſcerne who was the true God. How ſoeuer it be, <hi>Beltſazar</hi> here declareth in what eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had <hi>Daniel.</hi>

Howbeit God doth thus oftentymes wring out a confeſſion from the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, whereby they ſhould condemne themſelues, although they would moſt gladly anoyde it.</p>
                     <p>To the ſame effect alſo tendeth that which he ſayth: <hi>all the wyſe men and Southſayers, and Enchaunters were brought forth before me, which ſhould read the writing vnto me, and open the interpretation: but</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>they could not.</hi> For God did puniſh hym when in hys extreme neceſſity he ſhewed that all the <hi>Chaldees</hi> and Soothſayers, in whom yet he put his whole truſt, did nothing profit hym. Seyng then hys hope fayled hym, hereby he acknowledgeth that he was deceaued when he nouriſhed the Mages &amp; Soothſayers, and thouht that he was well defended wyth counſayle, ſo that he had them with him. In the meane ſeaſon, that the holy Prophet was reiected, it was intolerable vnto God, &amp; that worthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Beltſazar</hi> doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe thys, although he doth not thinke it.

                  <div type="meditation">
                     <p>Here <hi>Daniel</hi> doth firſt of all refuſe the rewards offered. We do not read that he did ſo before: no he ſéemed to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that which was geuen him of the king <hi>Nebuchadne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer.</hi> What is the cauſe of this diuerſity? for it is not lyke that the Prophete chaunged hys mynde or purpoſe. What is the cauſe then that he was content heretofore to receiue honour of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> and now refuſeth the honour offered? Agayne, here is an other doubt. For in the end of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chapter we ſhall ſée that he was clothed wyth pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and alſo it was publikely proclamed by decrée, that he ſhould be third in the kyngdome. Wherefore it ſéemeth that eyther the Prophet had forgotten hymſelfe when he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purple which he had ſo boldly refuſed: or els what is the cauſe why he did ſo, and did not deny afterward to weare thys princely apparell? For the firſt, I doubt not but that he would ſpeake more roughly to that wicked and deſperate <hi>Beltſazar:</hi> but becauſe that there remayned yet
<pb facs="tcp:7787:96"/> ſome goodnes in kyng <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> and he had good hope of hym, therefore did he treate hym more gently. As for kyng <hi>Beltſazar,</hi> it was of neceſſity that he ſhould be more roughly delt withall, becauſe he was come to all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities. I doubt not but that thys was the cauſe of the difference. For the Prophet went forward co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantly in hys courſe: but it was hys dutie to put a difference betwixt the diuerſitie of the perſons: and becauſe there was greater pride, obſtinacy, and ſtubbornes in the king <hi>Beltſazar,</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he declareth that he geueth vnto hym leſſe honor then he did vnto hys Grandfather. Furthermore the tyme of the captiuitie &amp; ſubiection was now at an end, in reſpect wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he did before reuerence the Monarchy of the <hi>Chaldees.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As concerning the contrariety which appeareth betwixt hys aunſwere and hys fact (whereof we ſhall ſpeake after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) it ought not to ſéeme ſtraunge vnto vs, if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet did at the firſt teſtify that he did not regard the kynges rewardes, and yet did not contend ouer behemently in the refuſall, leſt he myght ſéeme to do it craftely for the auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of preſent perill. He would ſhew therfore a great bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in both twaine. That he beginneth hys preface wyth the refuſall of the kynges giftes, he knoweth that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is but for a moment: Agayne that he receiueth the purple and other honours, he doth it becauſe he might haue ſuffered blame if he had vtterly refuſed it: for it had bene a ſigne of fearefulnes, which myght alſo haue bene ſuſpected of treaſon.</p>
                     <p>The Prophet therefore declareth that he doth boldly deſpiſe all that dignity that kyng <hi>Beltſazar</hi> offered hym (for he was now as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> halfe dead) and doth in the meane ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhew hymſelfe not to feare any perill at all. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings deſtruction was at hand, and the City either the ſame houre or within few houres after was taken. <hi>Daniel</hi> therefore doth not refuſe this purple, to declare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he feared not death if néede ſo conſtrayned.</p>
                     <p>He myght haue bene more ſafe in hys ſecret places, if he had bene amongeſt the common people and without the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7787:96"/> Court: Againe if he had bene cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted as one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, he myght haue bene in leſſe daunger. When he then doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not to receaue the purple, he ſheweth hymſelfe to be wythout all feare. In the meane time there is no doubt but that he would beat downe the fooliſh arrogancy of the king, when he ſayth: <hi>take thy giftes to thy ſelfe &amp; geue thy rewardes vnto others,</hi> I care not for them. When he deſpiſeth the kynges liberalitie in ſuch ſort, he doth it doubtles to correct the kynges pride wherewyth he was puffed, or at the leaſt he would wound and pricke hys conſcience that he myght féele Gods iudgement, whereof <hi>Daniel</hi> ſhould afterward be both a preacher and a witnes.</p>

                     <p>Before that <hi>Daniel</hi> doth rehearſe the writing, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he geueth the interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof, he admoniſheth the kyng of the cauſe of thys wonder. For it had not bene mete to haue begonne with the reading, to haue ſayd <hi>[mene me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne]</hi> as we ſhall ſée in the end of the Chapter: the king could not ſo haue profited by ſuch a ſhort maner of ſpeach. But here he declareth that it is no maruaile though God did ſtretch forth hys hand or put forth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> likenes of a hand which
<pb facs="tcp:7787:97"/> did write the kynges deſtruction, becauſe the kyng had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinatly prouoked Gods wrath. We ſée then why <hi>Daniel</hi> beginneth wyth thys hiſtory, that <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> was a great Monarch, that he had ſubdued the whole world vnto hym, that all men feared hys countenaunce: agayne, that he was caſt downe from the throne af hys kingdome, euen for thys purpoſe, to make it more playne that <hi>Beltſazar</hi> did not treſpaſſe of ignoraunce, becauſe that he ought ſoberly and modeſtly to haue behaued himſelf, conſidering that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and meruelous example of hys Grandfather. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thys domeſticall admonition did nothing profit hym, <hi>Daniel</hi> declareth that the tyme is now at hand when God wyll ſhew his wrath vpon him, euen by a fearefull wonder. Thys is the ſumme. But as touching the wordes, he ſayth firſt of all, that there was geuen to king <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> from God an Empire, a maieſtie, honor, and glory: as if he ſhould ſay, he was magnified and adorned of God, that he ſhould be the Monarch of the whole world.</p>
                     <p>We haue ſayd before, and <hi>Daniel</hi> wyll repete it agayne in many places, that kyngdomes do not come vnto men by chaunce and fortune,<note place="margin">Rom. 13 1.</note> but from God, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth: <hi>that there is no power but of God.</hi> And God wyll haue hys proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to appeare after a ſpeciall maner in the diſtribution of kyngdomes. For although God gouerne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world, and thynges which ſéeme moſt ſmall in the gouernment of mankinde are ruled by hys hand: yet hys ſpeciall prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce doth appeare moſt euidently in kingdomes and Empires. And <hi>Daniel</hi> to confirme thys doctrine, addeth: <hi>that for the gaeat authority that God gaue hym, all men did tremble before hym.</hi> Whereby he ſignifieth that the glory of God is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in kynges perſones ſo long as he wyll haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to raigne. Thys can not be outwardly ſéene, but the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſelfe declareth it playnely, that kynges are armed wyth authority from God, in that they are able thus to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne vnder their hand and at their appointment, great multitudes of men: for amongeſt mortall men, euery one deſireth to be the chiefe. How doth it then come to paſſe,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7787:97"/> ſeyng ambition is ſo fixed in all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s harts, that many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands wyll ſubmit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vnto one, and ſuffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be ruled, yea that they can ſuffer at the handes of ſuch many iniuries? What is the cauſe hereof, but that God doth arme wyth the ſword and power, whom he wyll haue to be excellent in the world? This reaſon therefore is dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to be noted that the prophet ſaith, that all did tremble at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſight of king <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> becauſe God had made hym great, that is to ſay, becauſe God would haue hym ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent aboue others in the world.</p>
                     <p>God hath many cauſes and thoſe many tymes moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, why he doth extoll him and caſt downe an other. How<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beit this muſt we know without all doubt, that no kyngs come to authority vnles GOD lend them hys hand, and ſtyll ſtabliſhe them therein: and when hee wyll take away their power, they fall ſpedely: not that there commeth any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by chaunce in theſe mutations and chaunges, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that God, as is written in the booke of <hi>Iob,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iob. 12.18</note> doth looſe their girdles whom he had before girded.</p>
                     <p>Then it followeth: <hi>whom he would kill he killed, whom he would he did ſmite</hi> Some thinke that the abuſe of the kinges power is here noted. But I had rather take it ſimply, that <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> had authority to caſt downe whom he would, and to exalt whom he would that it was in hys po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to geue lyfe and to take away lyfe. I do not therefore referre theſe wordes to tyrannicall luſt, as though <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezer</hi> had murthered many innocentes, had ſhed ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s bloud without reaſon, or had ſpoyled many of their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and had made other rich or rayſed them to honours: I do not take it ſo: but that it was in hys power either to kill or to geue life, to ſet vp or to caſt downe.</p>
                     <p>To be ſhort, me thinke that <hi>Daniel</hi> doth here deſcribe what power kynges haue, which may thus fréely deale wyth their ſubiectes: not becauſe it is lawfull, but becauſe none dare ſpeake agaynſt it. For whatſoeuer pleaſeth the king, all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are compelled to agrée thereunto, or at the leaſt no man dare ſtirre againſt it. Seing that kynges then haue
<pb facs="tcp:7787:98"/> ſuch liberty, <hi>Daniel</hi> declareth that this kyng <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezer</hi> was not rayſed hereunto by hys owne induſtry, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or counſayle, or by hys good fortune: but he ſaith that he gate thys great Empire, and that he was terrible vnto all, becauſe God had adorned hym wyth that glory. In the meane tyme yet it behoueth all kynges to regard, what is lawfull and what GOD permitteth them to do. For as they are kynges, ſo muſt they conſider alſo that they muſt once geue accomptes to the moſt high kyng. We can not gather hereby then that kinges are conſtitute of God to be lawles, to liue without order and to do what they liſt. But the Prophet (as I haue ſayd) ſpeaketh of the power that they haue. And ſeing that kinges haue power of death and life ouer their ſubiectes, he ſaith that the life of them al was in king <hi>Nebuchadnezers</hi> hand.</p>
                     <p>Then he ſayth: <hi>VVhen his heart was lifted vp, then was he caſt downe from the throne of his kingdome, and they ſpoyled him of his dignitie.</hi> He proſecuteth that which he began. His purpoſe is to declare to kyng <hi>Beltſazar,</hi> that GOD for a ſpace doth ſuffer their pride which do forget hym when they haue gotten high authoritie. Therfore ſayth he: kyng <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> thy grandfather was an hye Monarch: this did hée not atteine of himſelfe, neither yet did hée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine the Empire and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue therein, but as he was ſtayd &amp; vpholden by the hand of God. Now the tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſformation of him into a boaſt, was a notable document, that their pryde can not alwayes bee ſuffered, which are vnthankefull vnto God, and do not acknowledge that they do reigne by hys benefite. <hi>VVhen his hart therfore was lifted vp</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>and his mynde was</hi> ſet vpon pride, there came a ſodaine chaunge. Hereby ſhouldeſt thou haue learned O kyng, and all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie, to deceiue your ſelues no longer with pride: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of this thy forefather ſhould ſtrike thy hart. Wherfore this writyng is ſet before thyne eyes, whereby thou mayſt vnderſtand that both thy kyngdome and thy life are euen now at an end.</p>
                     <p>And this ſentence is to be noted, that <hi>Daniel</hi> ſayth: <hi>That
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7787:98"/> his heart was hardned in pride.</hi> For he geueth vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that he was not puffed vp ſodainly with a light folie, as vayne men many tymes vſe to bee when there is no cauſe, and no inward motion of the minde goeth before: but hée would vtter vnto vs a greater matter, that this pride had now bene nouriſhed in his hart along tyme: as though hée ſhould ſay, that he was not taken with a ſodaine vayne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that hée had ſo long bent him ſelfe vpon pride, that he was obſtinate and hardened therin.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:7787:99"/> hys grandfather <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> though hee were not chaunged into a beaſt, yet at the leaſt he was caſt forth of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s company, &amp; that hee was deformed throughout all his body, &amp; that he him ſelfe abhorred mans co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany &amp; would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dwell with brute beaſtes. This was a horrible exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, eſpecially in ſuch a great monarch, and worthy to be left in memory to the poſteritie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hand to ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d euen to a thouſand generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, if that Monarch had endured ſo long. But that his nephew had ſo ſoone forgotten this leſſon, hereby is hee worthely reproued of ſhamefull ſecuritie and careleſnes. This then is the cauſe why <hi>Daniel</hi> doth agayne rehearſe the hiſtory: <hi>He was cast forth from the ſonnes of men</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>and his hart was lyke the beaſtes,</hi> that is to ſay, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of reaſon and iudgement for a tyme. And we know that this is the chief difference betwixt men and beaſtes, that men do vnderſtand and iudge: but the brute beaſtes are onely caryed by their ſenſes. God therfore ſhewed a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible example vpon this kyng when he thus ſpoyled him of reaſon and vnderſtandyng.</p>
                     <p>He ſayth: <hi>That his habitation was with the wilde Aſſes,</hi> which before had dwelt in that palace which was knowne to all the world, from whence all the people of the Eaſt did at that tyme receiue their lawes. Therefore ſeyng he was wont to be worſhipped for a God, this was a terrible iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that afterward he dwelt with the wilde beaſtes. And whereas now they fed him with graſſe like a bullocke, which before had all maner of delicates at his pleaſure, and was wont to be fed ſo dayntely as the aboundance of hys kyngdome would beare: eſpecially ſeyng the Eaſt partes are more delicate then all other, and that <hi>Babylon</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the mother of all riotouſnes: ſeyng the condition of the kyng was ſo chaunged, all men might know that this was not done by fortune, but by the rare and the ſingular iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. Afterward he addeth that which he ſpake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: <hi>That his body was watered with the rayne of heauen, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he knew that the hygh God dyd rule in the kingdome of men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here is agayne expreſſed the end of his puniſhment, that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7787:99"/> 
                        <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> ſhould know that he was made kyng by Gods appointment, &amp; that no earthly kings ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt and but as God ſtayeth them by his hand &amp; power. But they do thinke them ſelues to be ſet ſafe and ſure from all chaunges and miſfortunes. And though they ſet forth for a ſhew in theyr titles theſe wordes, that they do reigne by the grace of God: yet do they deſpiſe all that is of God and God him ſelfe, for they take vnto them ſelues the glory of God. This is the madnes of all kynges, as may be gathered of theſe wordes. For if kyng <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> had bene perſuaded of this, that kinges are ſet in place by God, and that they do depend onely of hys good pleaſure, and that they ſtand or faull as he decréeth: there had bene no nede of this puniſhment, as is plainely expreſſed in theſe wordes. Therfore he ſhut forth God from the gouernement of the world. And this is the commune maner of all earthly kynges, as I haue ſayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. They will all (I grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) profeſſe otherwiſe: but the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt doth not regard ſuch feyned proteſtations, as they tearme them.</p>
                     <p>Wherfore in the perſon of kyng <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> the dronken preſumption of all kynges is ſet forth vnto vs as in a glaſſe, that they thinke in dede that they ſtand by theyr own power, and they exempt them ſelues from the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, as though he did not ſit as iudge in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens. It was neceſſary therefore that <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> ſhould be humbled, vntill that he did know that God reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vpon the earth, becauſe that by commune opinion they do ſhut him vp in the heauen, as though he were contented with his reſt, and had no care for mankynd.</p>
                     <p>In the end is added: <hi>and whom he pleaſeth, he ſetteth ouer it.</hi> Which expreſſeth more playnely that which he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken darkly, how that <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> beyng daunted, tamed, and brought down by ſeuere puniſhment, did know that God raigneth in the earth. For when earthly Princes behold them ſelues ſo defended with their Gardes, ſo to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with riches that they can with a word gather great armies, when they ſée alſo that all men are afrayde of them,
<pb facs="tcp:7787:100"/> they thinke that God hath no more authoritie ouer them, and they can not perceiue how any chaunge can come vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as it is ſpoken of all the proude perſons in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pſalme:<note place="margin">Pſal. 10.6.</note> &amp; as <hi>Iſaiah</hi>

Now it is credible that his father <hi>Euilmerodah</hi> had alſo forgotten that puniſhment: yet becauſe hee did not deale ſo diſſolutly agaynſt God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he reproch the true and ſincere Religion, God dyd ſpare the miſerable tyraunt which did reteyne hym ſelfe in ſome mediocritie. But as concernyng his nephew <hi>Beltſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> he was altogether intolerable: therefore God ſtriketh kim. This is it that the Prophet now teacheth: <hi>Thou art his ſonne</hi> (ſayth he). He vrgeth him with this circumſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he neded not to fetch an example farre from ſtraunge nations, when he might know at home that thyng which was mete and neceſſary to bee knowen. And he doth alſo amplifie the crime after an other ſort, when he ſayth: <hi>Thou diddeſt know all this.</hi> For men vſe to pretend ignoraunce for a ſhielde, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they extenuate their faultes and excuſe their
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7787:100"/> crimes: but they which wittingly and willingly do offende, want all excuſe. The Prophet therfore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uinceth this kyng of manifeſt contumacy: as though he ſhould ſay, that he had prouoked Gods wroth of ſet purpoſe, becauſe he was not ignoraunt how great and how horrible a iudgement doth belong to all proude perſons, in that he hath ſuch a wonder full notable example in his grandfather, which ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes haue bene in his remembraunce.</p>

                     <p>Here <hi>Daniel</hi> doth expound thoſe foure wordes which were written on the wall. The king could not read them, eyther becauſe he was aſtoniſhed, or becauſe God had trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled all hys ſenſes, and had, as it were dawbed vp his eyes. And the ſame may we ſay alſo of the Mages and Soothſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. They myght haue read, if they had not bene blynded by God. <hi>Daniel</hi> doth firſt of all therefore rehearſe thoſe fower wordes, <hi>mene, mene, tekel, vpharſin.</hi> Then doth he
<pb facs="tcp:7787:102"/> interprete the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. One word is twiſe rehearſed, <hi>Mene.</hi> Some do thus diuide it, that both the yeares of the life of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king, and alſo the tyme of the kynges raygne was numbred. But this ſubtilty ſemeth not ſubſtantiall. Therefore I thinke that this word was added twiſe for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation: as though the Prophet ſhould ſay, that the number was now fulfilled. For in accomptes it is eaſy to fayle, as the prouerbe is. Wherefore that <hi>Beltſazar</hi> myght vnderſtand that hys lyfe and hys kingdome was now at an end, God doth affirme that the number is full and perfect: as though he ſhould ſay, that there ſhould not be added one minute of an houre to the terme appointed. And thus doth <hi>Daniel</hi> hym ſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete the ſame <hi>God</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>hath numbred thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> that is, God hath appoynted and determined an end of thy kingdome, ſo that it muſt néedes come to an end be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the tyme is accompliſhed.</p>
                     <p>Although here God ſpeake but to one king, and the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was ſet before hys eyes: yet may we gather a generall doctrine hereof, that God hath determined a certayne time to all kingdomes.<note place="margin">Iob. 14.5.</note> The ſcripture teſtifieth the ſame of euery one of our liues. If God then haue appointed to euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hys dayes, much more may it be ſayd of publike Empyres and kingdomes, becauſe they are of greater importance. Therefore let vs know that not onely kinges do lyue or die, but that kyngdomes are chaunged alſo by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment (as is ſayd before) and that they are ſo ſet vp by God, that he appointeth them alſo their certayne end. And hereof ſhould we take comfort when we ſée tyrauntes deale ſo outragiouſly that there is no meaſure in their luſtes and cruelly. When then they do ſo rage as though they would mixe heauen and earth together, let vs remember this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: <hi>that their yeares are numbred.</hi> God knoweth how long it is expedient for them to raigne: he can not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued. For vnles he did know it to be profitable for the church and his elect that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyrantes ſhould rage for a time, doubtles he would ſtraight wayes bridle them and plucke them downe: but becauſe he hath appointed the number
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7787:102"/> from the beginning, let vs know that the full tyme of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is not yet come, as long as he ſuffereth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to abuſe ſo licenciouſly their rule and power graunted vnto them of God.</p>
                     <p>Now foloweth the expoſition of the word, <hi>tekel. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou waſt weighed in the balance</hi>
                        </hi> (ſayth he) <hi>and wast found faulty.</hi> Heare <hi>Daniel</hi> declareth that God doth ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hys iudgementes, as if he did holde the balance in hys hand. It is a ſimilitude borowed of the cuſtome of men. We know that the vſe of the balance is, that there ſhould be a certaine meaſure and an equall diſtributio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in thinges. So alſo is it written that God doth all thinges by waight and meaſure, becauſe he doth nothing confuſedly,<note place="margin">Sap. 11.21</note> but with ſuch meaſure, that there can be neither more nor leſſe, as the common ſaying is. For this cauſe <hi>Daniel</hi> ſayth: <hi>that Beltſazar was weighed in the balaunce,</hi> that is to ſay, that God was not haſty in puniſhing of hym, but did execute that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment iuſtly, after his vſuall manner and continuall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: <hi>becauſe he was found faulty,</hi> that is, becauſe he was light and of no weight: As though he ſhould ſay, thou ſuppoſeſt that thyne honour ſhould be ſpared, and becauſe all men do reuerence thee, thou thinkeſt thy ſelfe worthy of honour. Thou art deceaued (ſayth he) for the iudgement of God is otherwiſe. God doth not vſe the common balance, but he hath waightes of hys owne, and thereby <hi>thou art found faulty,</hi> that is, nothing worth, a man of no reputation. There is no doubt but the tyrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was greatly moued with theſe wordes: but becauſe hys end was come, he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſuffer the voyce of the preacher. And vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God dyd bridle hys rage becauſe he ſhould not ryſe vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt <hi>Daniel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the end is added this word <hi>[Peres]</hi> for the word <hi>[Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harſin],</hi> that <hi>his kingdome is diuided,</hi> that is to ſay, by the <hi>Medes</hi> and the <hi>Perſians.</hi> I doubt not but that God did ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify by that word the deſtruction of the Monarchy which was at hand. When he ſayth therefore <hi>[Vpharſin] <hi>and they ſhall diuide,</hi>
                        </hi> he meaneth that this Monarchy can continue
<pb facs="tcp:7787:103"/> no longer, becauſe he will diuide it and breake it aſunder. But the Prophet doth allude very aptly to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuiſion which was made betwixt the <hi>Medes</hi> &amp; the <hi>Perſians:</hi> and ſo was their ſhame encreaſed: for the <hi>Babylonians</hi> were compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſerue two ſundry Lordes.</p>
                     <p>It is a great griefe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any people hath gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dominion farre and large, and beyng afterward ouercome, ſhould be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to beare the yoke of one Lord: but when there be two Lordes, this increaſeth the griefe. So therefore <hi>Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> doth ſhew, that the vengeaunce of God ſhall not be ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple when the Monarchy of <hi>Babylon</hi> is ſcattered abroad: and this ſhal alſo encreaſe the greatnes of the puniſhment, that the <hi>Medes</hi> and the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſhall rule ouer them. But true it is that the Citie was taken by the ſtrength and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of <hi>Cyrus:</hi> but becauſe <hi>Cyrus</hi> did geue ſo great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to hys father in law, that he did willingly admit hym to the ſociety of the kyngdome, therefore the <hi>Medes</hi> and the <hi>Perſians</hi> are ſayd to haue diuided betwixt them that kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, although there was properly no diuiſion of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. <hi>Cyrus</hi> afterward, as he was rauiſhed wyth an inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable ambition and couetouſnes, was drawen forth into other warres. But <hi>Darius,</hi> who was aboue <hi>60.</hi> yeares old, (as we ſhal ſée afterward) did remaine quietly at home. He was of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Medes,</hi> as is well knowne. For if we ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue many hiſtoriographers, his ſiſter the mother of <hi>Cyrus</hi> was, as it were baniſhed into <hi>Perſia,</hi> becauſe there was a prophecy of the greatnes of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Who becauſe his Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father had geuen hym out to be deſtroyed, did afterward reuenge this iniury: yet not ſo cruelly but that he ſpared his life. He was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent that he ſhould remayne in ſome honor, and made hym a gouernor. And after this hys ſonne rayg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ouer the <hi>Medes,</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſuffered it willingly. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> maried hys daughter. So what for kinred, and what for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of thys new affinity, he was wylling to haue hym pertaker of hys Empire. In thys ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe doth <hi>Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> ſpeake of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Monarchy to be at hand: becauſe the <hi>Medes</hi> and the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſhould diuide it betwixt them.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7787:103"/> 
                        <hi>29</hi> Then at the commaundement of Beltſazar, they cloched Daniel wyth purple, &amp; put a chaine of golde about hys necke, and made a proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning hym, that he ſhould be the third ruler in the kingdome.</p>
                     <p>It is meruaile that the king gaue ſuch commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when he was thus roughly handled of the Prophet. It appeareth that hys hart did then fayle hym. For before he would haue raged wythout meaſure, and would haue commaunded thys holy Prophyt of God to haue bene put to death. How then doth it come to paſſe that he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth hym to be appareled like a kyng, and cauſeth hym to be proclamed the third in the kingdome? Some thinke that thys was done becauſe the lawes of the kinges of <hi>Babylon</hi> were in great reuerence, yea their wordes were ſure, and whatſoeuer they ſpake was vnchaungeable &amp; inmoueable. They thinke therefore that this came of the regard of hys honor, that king <hi>Beltſazar</hi> did performe his promiſe. But I ſuppoſe that he was firſt aſtoniſhed when he heard the Prophet, and ſo became like a blocke or a ſtone: howbeit I thinke that he did thys for his owne ſafety. For he myght haue bene brought into contempt with his nobles if he had not ſhewed ſome courage. Wherefore that he myght ſhew hymſelfe not to be moued, he commaunded <hi>Daniel</hi> thus to be adorned, as though that threatning had bene of no force. He did not deſpiſe that which had bene ſpoken by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: but he would haue hys Princes perſwaded and all them which were at the feaſt, that God did threaten onely to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> afrayde, but not to execute ſo greuous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And the kynges when they are moſt afrayde, are yet very ware of this alwayes that they ſhew no ſigne of their feare: for they thinke that their authority ſhould therby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay. Wherefore, that he may kéepe hys authority wyth hys ſubiectes, he would ſéeme altogether careles and wythout all feare. I doubt not but that thys was the deuiſe of thys
<pb facs="tcp:7787:104"/> tyraunt, when he commaunded <hi>Daniel</hi> to be adorned with purple and princely ornamentes.</p>

For they ſay that the kyng was ſlaine, becauſe that one of the Garde heard the voyce of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and therefore would execute that iudgement of God: as though forſooth, that the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God ſhould depend of one prophane mans wyll or pleaſure. Wherefore paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ouer ſuch childiſh trifles, we muſt remember the truth of the hiſtory, that <hi>Beltſazar</hi> was taken in hys feaſt, when he had made hymſelfe dronken and rioted wyth his noble men and concubines. In the meane time we may obſerue the meruelous mercy of God toward the Prophet. For it was not poſſible but that he was in daunger amongeſt the reſt.

And there is no doubt but that this holy Prophet was ſore troubled in that tumult: for he was no ſtocke. But it was neceſſary that he ſhould be thus exerciſed, that he might know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God was the kéeper of hys lyfe, and that he ſhould therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that his father in law ſhould haue the title, whom he ſaw to be aged and worne. But thys is vncertayne, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thys were the ſonne of <hi>Aſtyages</hi> and ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vncle of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> or no. For many hiſtoriographers conſent together in thys, that <hi>Aſtiages</hi> was the Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dfather of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> &amp; that he maried his daughter to <hi>Cambyſes:</hi> becauſe he had learned of the Aſtrologians that the childe that ſhould be borne of her, ſhould be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord of all <hi>Aſia.</hi> And they tell many things beſide, how he commaunded <hi>Cyrus</hi> in hys infancy to be ſlayne: but becauſe theſe things are vncertayne, I do paſſe ouer them. Me thinke this is like to be true, that <hi>Darius</hi> was both vncle and father in law to <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Although, if we do beleue <hi>Xenophon,</hi> he was not yet maryed when <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> was woonne. For this hys father in law or vncle, being vnable to deale wyth the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Cyrus</hi> to ayde hym. Howſoeuer it is, thys that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſayth, may agrée well enough, that <hi>Darius</hi> the kyng of the <hi>Medes</hi> receaued the kyngdome: becauſe that <hi>Cyrus,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he was more mighty and of greater authority, yet wyllingly yelded vnto hym to be the kyng of <hi>Babylon:</hi> and ſo was he kyng but by title onely ouer the <hi>Chaldees.</hi>

                     <p>Thys then is to be noted, that <hi>Daniel</hi> was choſen one of the thrée gouerners by <hi>Darius.</hi> He had bene now the third vnder king <hi>Beltſazar,</hi> though it were but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: yet thys myght haue brought hym into hatred wyth the new kyng, becauſe he had ſuch honour geuen him.

                     <p>And hereby we gather that this was the worke of God, that he ſhould be amongeſt the chiefe gouerners and the third in the kyngdome, whereby he myght be more eaſily knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto <hi>Darius.</hi> For if <hi>Daniel</hi> had bene caſt down by kyng <hi>Beltſazar,</hi> he had layne vnknowne at home: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſéeth him in princely apparell, he enquireth who he is.

                        <hi>3</hi> Now this Daniel was preferred aboue the rulers and gouerners, becauſe the ſpirite was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in hym, and the king thought to ſet hym ouer the whole realme.</p>

                  <div type="meditation">
                     <p>Now the Prophet ſetteth forth the tentation that dyd ariſe ſodainly, which might haue driuen both hymſelfe and the elect people to deſpayre, but that God worketh miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly. For although onely <hi>Daniel</hi> was caſt into the denne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lyons, as foloweth: yet vnleſſe he had bene deliuered, the condition of the whole people had bene more greuous and rigorous. For we know how impudently wicked men do rayle againſt miſerable innocentes, when they do ſée any aduerſity towardes them. If <hi>Daniel</hi> therefore had bene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured by the Lyons, all men would haue raged againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes wyth all their power. God therefore did not onely herein exerciſe the fayth and patience of hys ſeruaunt, but alſo he proued the Iewes by the ſame trial, becauſe they did ſée themſelues ready to ſuffer all extremity in the perſon of one man, vnleſſe God had ſodenly holpen them as he did. Firſt of all <hi>Daniel</hi> ſayth: <hi>That he was preferred aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becauſe a more excellent ſpirite was in hym.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This doth not alwayes come to paſſe, that they which are excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in wiſdome or other ſuch giftes, haue alſo more authoritie and fauour. For in kinges courtes wee ſée very beaſtes in the chiefe offices. And at this day (to leaue of old hiſtories) as all kinges almoſt are fooliſh and bruttſh: ſo alſo
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7787:106"/> are they the horſes and aſſes of brute beaſtes. Wherefore the more proude and diſſolute euery man is, the more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie hath hee in Princes courtes. But when <hi>Daniel</hi> ſayth, <hi>that he was excellent,</hi> he commendeth two benefites of God: the one, that he was endued with more aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce of Gods ſpirite: the other, that <hi>Darius</hi> did know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this, and therefore ſet hym in honour when he did ſée hym to be a man of great vertue &amp; wiſdome. We perceaue then that which the Prophet would here teach, that he was endued from heauen with wiſdome and other giftes: and alſo that king <hi>Darius</hi> iudged a right in weighing hys wyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and other vertues, and therefore ſet him in honour. Becauſe then a more aboundaunt ſpirite was in hym, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did he excell all others. Yea the king minded to ſet hym aboue all his kyngdome, euen aboue thoſe thrée gouerners.</p>
                     <p>Now, although this was a ſingular priuiledge which God did the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vouchſafe to beſtow vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his people &amp; his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: yet haue we great cauſe at thys day to lament, that kynges do ſo proudly contemne the giftes of God in all the beſt men which might be moſt profitable rulers of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in the meane ſeaſon ſet ſo much by blockeheades, like themſelues, and me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are geuen to couetouſnes and extortion, yea moſt cruell and diſſolute in all wickednes. Seyng then we ſée that there is no wiſdome or diſcretion in kynges to diſcerne who are worthy of rule and authority, we may worthely bewayle the ſtate of the world: for thys is vnto vs a manifeſt ſpectacle of the vengeaunce of God, when kinges are ſo deſtitute of wiſdome. But king <hi>Darius</hi> alone ſhalbe ſufficient at the great day to condemne them: who had ſo great a iudgement, that he doubted not to ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all hys officers, a man that was a ſtraunger and a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. This was therefore a right princelike and heroicall vertue, that <hi>Darius</hi> preferred one captiue before all his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars. But now kynges regard nothing els but to ſet in authority their baudes, their ieſters, &amp; their flatterers. So in the meane tyme they ſet none vp but euill men, of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lewe, and whom God hath marked wyth ſome note of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy:
<pb facs="tcp:7787:107"/> who though they be vnworthy to be counted in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> number of men, yet are they kynges of kinges: for kynges are at thys day for the moſt part but ſeruauntes. And this commeth vpon them for their ſlouthfull negligence, which refuſe and caſt away from them all cares, and will take no paynes. Therefore are they compelled to commit the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment vnto others, retayning onely the title to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Theſe things (as I haue ſayd) are certayne tokens of Gods wrath: becauſe the world is vnworthy that God ſhould ſtretch forth hys hand to gouerne it.</p>
                     <p>Now, as concernyng the enuie of the nobles, we ſée that this vice hath reigned in all ages, that they deſpiſe vertue which do ambitiouſly aſpire to honour. For ſeyng they are giltie in their owne conſciences, they can not but hate the vertue of others. Yet this may be though nothyng ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, that the <hi>Perſians</hi> which had ſuſteined great labours and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken great daungers, could not ſuffer a baſe and an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen man, not onely to be made a companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto them, but alſo to be ſet ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a ſuperiour. Their enuy ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſéemed to haue ſome grounde, or at the leaſt ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. But this is a thyng moſt worthy to be condemned, that any man ſhould ſo be addicted to his own commoditie, that he ſhould not regard the common profite. For who ſo euer deſireth authoritie and doth therein regarde his owne profite onely, and not the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> commoditie of the people, he muſt nedes be couetous, a briber, cruel &amp; vnfaithful &amp; do nothyng leſſe then his office. Seyng then that the nobles of the kyngdome enuie <hi>Daniel,</hi> they bewray their wickednes therby, that they haue no regard of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth, but that they couet to ſcrape &amp; to catch all thinges to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues.</p>
                     <p>Now in this example we may ſée what commeth of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy. And this is diligently to bee noted, becauſe there is nothyng more eaſie then to fall from one vice to an other. He that enuieth an other can bee reſtreined by no equitie, but that he will try all meanes poſſible how he may ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw his aduerſary. Theſe nobles do ſtomake the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that <hi>Daniel</hi> ſhould be preferred before them. Now if
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7787:107"/> they went no further, yet that fault (as I haue ſayd) were a ſigne of a wicked nature. Howbeit they do burſt forth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for they ſéeke ſome quarell or ſome crime in <hi>Daniel.</hi> We may ſée therfore how enuy doth ſtyrre the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp to ſearch ſome crime. So are all enuious men, as it were in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all watch and warde, to catch them in a ſnare whoſe proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie they do enuy, and to ouerthrow them by any meanes. This is one point. But when they finde no crime, then tread they all equity vnder foote, and without all ſhame and humanitie, no leſſe cruelly then traiterouſly they giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues wholly to deſtroy their aduerſary. <hi>Daniel</hi> vttereth this of thoſe that enuyed him.</p>
                     <p>He ſayth firſt, <hi>That they ſought an occaſion and founde none.</hi> Then he ſheweth the occaſion which they tooke of no iuſt grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de but traiterouſly. For there is no doubt but that they did know <hi>Daniel</hi> to bee an holy man and approued of God. Wherfore when they lay ſnares for this holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, they fight agaynſt God, as it were of ſet purpoſe: but they are blinded with that wicked affection of enuy. And whence commeth enuy, but of ambition? So do we ſée am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to be a moſt wicked poyſon, wherof ſpringeth enuy, and of this doth falſhode and cruelty grow vp. But <hi>Daniel</hi> doth admoniſh vs by hys example, that we muſt labour to lyue vprightly, that the occaſion which the enuious and the wicked do ſéeke for, may be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away. Wherfore there can be no better defenſe agaynſt the enuious and the ſclaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, then to behaue our ſelues vprightly and innocently. For how ſoeuer they lay ſnares agaynſt vs, they ſhall not preuaile: for our innocency ſhall be like a ſhield to repulſe all their malice.</p>
                     <p>Yet do we ſée by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way that <hi>Daniel</hi> did not eſcape cleare: for a quarell was ſought agaynſt hym in an other matter, euen in the worſhyp of God. But here muſt we learne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that holynes and the care therof, ought to be more eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of vs then our owne lyues. <hi>Daniel</hi> was faithfull and vpright in his gouernment, he did execute his office ſo that he ſtopped the mouthes of hys enemyes and euilwyllers.
<pb facs="tcp:7787:108"/> Wherfore vpright dealyng (as I haue ſayd) is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beſt ſhield.</p>
                     <p>Agayne, <hi>Daniel</hi> was in daunger becauſe he would not forſake the pure worſhyp of God and his profeſſion. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt wee ſuffer daungers boldly and conſtantly when the queſtion ſhalbe touchyng the worſhyp of God. For this tranſitory lyfe ought not to be more deare vnto vs, then the moſt holy and precious thyng of all that is to ſay, that God may haue his due honour. We ſée then that we are taught to deale vprightly of the one part, becauſe we can not bée more ſafe by any meanes then by a ſafe conſcience, as <hi>Peter</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.16</note> doth exhorte vs by the ſame reaſon in his firſt Epiſtle. But what ſoeuer we feare, and what ende ſoeuer may folow, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though an hundreth deathes be offered vs, yet may we in no wiſe fayle from the pure worſhyp of God. For <hi>Daniel</hi> doubted not to enter into death and to go downe into the denne of Lyons, that hée might declare that he worſhypped the GOD of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Now that the nobles do fall to that barbarous and cruell counſaile, that is, that they might oppreſſe <hi>Daniel</hi> by the pretence of Religion, hereby we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how blinde the rage is whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ambition and enuy do poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe mens mindes: for they do nothyng feare at all to fight manifeſtly agaynſt God. For they do not aſſayle <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> as a man, but they breake forth moſt wickedly and ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tragiouſly agaynſt God, when they would extinguiſh the worſhip of God to ſatiſfie their luſt. Wherefore I ſay that we are admoniſhed by this example, how carefully wee ought to fly ambition and to take héede of it, and alſo of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy which ſpryngeth thereof.

<pb facs="tcp:7787:109"/> ſo blynde his eyes. But this coniecture doth not ſeme vnto me of any great weight: neither yet do I much trauaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this matter. For it may be that they would gratifie their kyng in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> begynnyng of this new kingdome, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they would decrée ſome new and ſtraunge thyng: the which thyng we do ſée often tymes to be done by ſuch as do flatter kynges and princes. Wherefore this old man might be deceiued herein now when his Monarchy was ſo lately encreaſed. He ruled onely ouer the <hi>Medes</hi> before: now came the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> the <hi>Aſsiria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi> and many other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vnder his Empire. Such an encreaſe of dominion might make him dronken with vaine glory: and the nobles thought that they had a plauſible matter in hand to decrée diuine honours vnto their kyng. Me thinke this one cauſe may ſuffice. Wherfore I am not to much carefull to ſearch any further: for I do take that which offereth it ſelfe and is moſt probable.</p>
                     <p>We ſayd before that the nobles which layd ſnares for <hi>Daniel,</hi> were ſtricken with a maruelous ragyng madnes, when they durſt publiſh this decrée vnto the kyng, which <hi>Daniel</hi> reciteth. For that was an intolerable ſacrilege, that the kyng ſpoyled all the Gods of their honour: yet dyd he ſigne and ſubſcribe the decrée, as foloweth, to the intent that he might hereby try the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his people, whom he lately brought into ſubiection by the helpe of his ſonne in law. For there is no doubt but that he ment to hold vnder the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> who had bene Lordes vntill this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t time. For we know how that pride of hart is engendred by pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er &amp; authoritie. When as the <hi>Chaldees</hi> therfore did reigne before this tyme ſo farre and ſo wyde, it was hard to bryng them downe and to make them ready to all obedience: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they dyd ſée them ſelues to be their ſeruauntes, whoſe equals they were before. For we know that they had often tymes encountered in battaile with the <hi>Medes.</hi> Although therfore they were now ouercome by the ſword, yet were not their hartes conquered. Therfore would <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> proue their obedience. This ſemeth to be the cauſe.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7787:109"/> For hée doth not of ſet purpoſe prouoke the wrath of the Gods agaynſt hym ſelfe, but whiles he regarded men, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate God &amp; ſet hym ſelfe in the place of the Gods, as though he had authoritie to plucke downe the power of the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to him ſelfe. This was an horrible ſacrilege, as I haue ſayd. But if any man could try the hartes of kynges, ſcarſely the hundreth man of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could be found which doth not after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame ſort deſpiſe all diuine power. For although they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe them ſelues to reigne by the grace of God, yet will they be worſhipped in Gods ſtead. And heare we ſée how eaſily flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers can perſuade princes any thyng that may ſeme to ſet out their honors and maieſties.</p>

                  <div type="meditation">
                     <p>Now <hi>Daniel</hi> declareth that he was endued with the ſtrength of the ſpirit of God that he might offer hys life vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God as a ſacrifice: becauſe he knew that there was no hope of pardon left hym if he had bene found to haue viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the kinges co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement. He knew alſo that the king hymſelfe ſhould not be frée, although he would pardon him, euen as it came to paſſe afterward. Seing then that death was before the Prophetes eyes, he had rather go vnto it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, then ceaſe from his duty in religion. We muſt note that here is nothing ſpoken of the inward worſhipping of God, but of the outward profeſſion. If <hi>Daniel</hi> had bene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to pray, this fortitude might ſéeme to be neceſſary wherewith he was endued: but now many may thinke that he was in ieoperdy without any great cauſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he dyd ſet himſelf forth to death, whereas he was onely reſtrayned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <pb facs="tcp:7787:111"/> the outward profeſſion.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe <hi>Daniel</hi> doth not here declare his owne ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but the ſpirit ſpeaketh by his mouth, we muſt marke that this boldnes of minde pleaſed God in the holy Prophet: and his deliuerance doth declare how greatly his Godly fact was allowed, in that he had rather to renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce his owne life then to chaunge any thing of his vſuall cuſtome in ſeruing of God. We do know that this is the chiefe ſacrifice which God requireth, euen to pray vnto God. For we do teſtify thereby, that he is the author and geuer of all good thinges vnto vs: and agayne we do geue a teſtimony of our fayth whiles we flie vnto hym, and caſt all our cares into hys bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and do offer vnto hym our requeſtes and deſires. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore that prayer hath the chiefe office in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſeruice of God, doubtles it was of no ſmall impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king forbad y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any man ſhould pray vnto God: for this was a manifeſt &amp; ouer groſſe deniall of religion. And hereby do we gather agayne how blinde the pride of thys kyng was, whiles he could ſubſcribe vnto their wicked and filthy decrée: againe how greatly the nobles raged, who that they might deſtroy <hi>Daniel,</hi> went about as much as in them lay, to deſtroy all religion and to plucke downe God from heauen. For what remayneth, when men thinke that they can want the helpe of God, and ſo haue no care of God at all? We know that vnleſſe God do ſtrengthen vs euery moment wyth hys power, we are eaſily brought to nought. When the king then did forbid all manner of prayer for a whole moneth, this was (as I haue ſayd) to require of euery man to deny God. Therefore <hi>Daniel</hi> could not obey the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crée without great iniury vnto God and falling from religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe this prayer is the chiefe ſacrifice that God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. Wherefore it is no meruaile though <hi>Daniel</hi> did boldly ſtand againſt thys curſed decrée. And concerning hys pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, it was neceſſary that he ſhould teſtify before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he did ſtand ſtedfaſtly in the worſhip of God. For if he had chaunged any thing of hys vſuall order, it had bene after a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7787:111"/> ſort a deniall of his religion. He had not publikely pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that he contemned God for <hi>Darius</hi> pleaſure: but the very chaunge had bene a ſigne of a traiterous defection and faythles falling from God. But we know that God doth not onely require the fayth of the hart and the inward affection, but alſo the teſtimony and profeſſion of our religion. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was his duty, vnleſſe he would haue bene a ſhamefull apoſtata, to continue in that holy cuſtome which he had v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For he was wont to pray vnto God with his windowes open. Therefore kept he his order leſt any man ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect againſt hym that he had caſt away the worſhip of God for a time to gratify an earthly king.</p>
                     <p>And would to God that this doctrine were now grauen ſo in the hartes of all men, as were conuenient. But this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Prophet is derided of many, not ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly I grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but ſo that it may eaſily appeare that the Prophet ſéemeth vnto them ouer ſimple and raſh, which offered himſelfe to daunger in vayne &amp; without neceſſity. For they do ſo ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate fayth from the profeſſion thereof, that they thinke they can remayne vpright, although it be hidden and buried, and although they fal from the pure and ſincere co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion of their faith an hundreth tymes for the auoiding of perſecution. Let vs conſider therefore that we ought not onely to offer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God the ſacrifice of prayer in our hartes: but alſo that an outward and frée profeſſion is required, that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare at the leaſt that we are the true worſhippers of God. Yet do I not ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ought to publiſh euery where what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we thinke, ſo that we ſhould ſtraightwayes be caryed vnto death by the enemies of God and of the Goſpell. But I ſay that theſe twayne are ioyned together, fayth and the profeſſion of fayth, ſo that they can in no wiſe be ſeparate.</p>
                     <p>Now, the profeſſion is after two ſortes. For eyther we do teſtify playnely and openly that which is in our mynde: or els ſo farre as is neceſſary, we kéepe vs in the worſhip of God, and geue no ſigne of wicked &amp; faithles diſſimulation, as though we ſhould caſt away the care of religion. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb facs="tcp:7787:112"/> the firſt, it is not neceſſary alwayes and at al times to profeſſe our fayth: but the ſecond muſt alway be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. For it ſhall neuer be lawfull for vs to diſſemble or to fayne any apoſtaſy or falling from religion.</p>
                     <p>Wherfore <hi>Daniel</hi> although he did not call together the <hi>Chaldees</hi> with ſound of trumpet ſo oft as hée would pray, but made his prayers and ſupplications in the chamber as he was wont: yet did he not diſſemble as though he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten his religion, when he ſéeth that his faith is tryed and that he is proued whether he will remaine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantly therin or no. For he playnely expreſſeth, that he came home after that he dyd know that the decrée was ſigned. Doubtles if he had bene called vnto that conſultation, he would not there haue holden his peace. But the reſidue of the nobles dyd craftely ſhut hym forth that he could not be at it: and they thought that the remedy ſhould be to late or none at all, like as he hym ſelfe dyd thinke that he ſhould dye. Wherfore if he had bene called to the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell by the kyng, he would there haue done his duty and would boldly haue treated vppon it. But becauſe the decrée was now ſigned, and he could not admoniſh the kyng, he went into his houſe. This is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that we may know that the kynges counſellers can not be excuſed by any meanes, which of purpoſe abſent them ſelues from conſultations when they ſée that they can not ſpeake their mindes without ſome daunger, and thinke that they haue done enough towardes God, ſo that they gyue no voyce but kéepe ſilence. Howbeit this faynt ſtomake can not be excuſed by any meanes. And <hi>Daniels</hi> example aſſuredly can not ſerue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: becauſe (as we haue ſayd) he was ſhut out by the craft and malice of the nobles, that he could not come in place to admoniſh the kyng in tyme as he was wont.</p>
                     <p>Now he ſayth, <hi>that the wyndowes were open toward Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> And it may be demaunded whether it were neceſſary for <hi>Daniel</hi> to open the windowes? for ſome man may obiect that he did this of ſome groſſe opinion. For if God do fill the heauen and the earth, what neded he to open the wyndowes
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7787:112"/> towards <hi>Ieruſalem?</hi> But there is no doubt but that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet dyd thus ſtyrre vp him ſelfe to more feruent prayer by this helpe and meanes. He prayed then for the deliueraunce of the people: and when he looked towardes <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> that ſight was as a ſpurre wherby his mynde might be the more inflamed. The Prophet dyd not then open the wyndowes in reſpect of God, as though he ſhould more eaſily be heard if there were an ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> way through the ayre betwixt his houſe and <hi>Iudea,</hi> but he rather regarded hym ſelfe and dyd helpe his owne infirmitie. Now if the holy Prophet dyd ſtand nede of this ayde who was ſo diligent in prayer, we muſt conſider that our ſlouthfull infirmitie ſtandeth nede of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moe helpes at this day. Let vs learne therfore when we do féele our ſelues to be ouer ſlouthfull &amp; colde vnto prayer, that we muſt gather all helpes and aydes which may way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken our diligence and may redreſſe our ſlouth which we do féele in our ſelues. This then was the purpoſe of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet when he opened his windowes towardes <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Agayne, by this ſigne he would ſignifie to him ſelfe and to his familie, that be doth continue in the fayth and hope of the redemption promiſed. When he prayed vnto God, he had <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> as it were in hys ſight, not that his eyes could ſée ſo farre: but he turned his eyes towardes <hi>Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        </hi> at that tyme, as though he ſhould ſay that he was a ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger among the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> although he was both rich and in great honor there and of great power. Thus would he haue it knowne to all men, that he dyd reſt vpon the heritage pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, although for a tyme he was baniſhed from thence. This was the ſecond cauſe why he opened the wyndowes.</p>
                     <p>He ſayd alſo, <hi>that he prayed three tymes a day.</hi> And this is to be marked: for vnleſſe euery one of vs appoint our ſelues cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine houres for prayer, we ſhal eaſily forget to pray. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Daniel,</hi> although he was diligent in pouryng forth his prayers, yet dyd he appoynt hym ſelfe this ſolemne or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he dyd fal downe before God thriſe euery day.<note place="margin">☜</note> Like as when we riſe in the mornyng, vnleſſe we begyn with
<pb facs="tcp:7787:113"/> prayer vnto God, it is a brutiſh dulnes: ſo alſo when we go to bed, when we take our repaſt, and ſo at other houres, as euery man findeth it moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient for him ſelfe: for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God geueth vs libertie: howbeit euery man muſt féele his infirmitie that he may ſéeke for remedy. For this cauſe then dyd <hi>Daniel</hi> pray thriſe a day.</p>
                     <p>Here is added alſo a ſigne of his feruent prayer when it is ſayd: <hi>That he fell downe vpon his knees:</hi> not that knéelyng is a neceſſary poynt of it ſelfe in prayer: but becauſe we haue nede of ſpurres and prickes (as we haue ſayd) knéelyng doth much profite. For firſt of all we are admoniſhed that we can not ſtand before God but with humilitie and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: agayne, hereby our mindes are better prepared to earneſt prayer, and ſo this ſigne of worſhyppyng is accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto God. Wherfore it is not in vayne that <hi>Daniel</hi> ſayth: <hi>that he dyd fall vppon his knees as oft as hee would pray vnto God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, where he ſayth: <hi>that hee prayed, and confeſſed or prayſed God,</hi> this is diligently to be noted, becauſe many do murmure agaynſt God in their prayers. For although they pray for this or that earneſtly, yet are they caried with ſuch immoderate vehemency, that they murmure agaynſt God as I haue ſaid) in their prayers, vnleſſe God ſtraight wayes graunt their requeſtes. This is the cauſe why <hi>Daniel</hi> ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth prayſes or thankeſgeuyng with prayer, euen as <hi>Paul</hi> alſo doth exhort vs to both twaine:<note place="margin">Phil. 14.6</note> 
                        <hi>Let your prayers</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>be knowen vnto God with thankesgeuyng.</hi> As though he ſhould ſay, that we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not make prayers and petitions before God aright, vnleſſe we bleſſe his holy name, although he do not geue vs ſtraight wayes our requeſtes. And the circumſtance is to be noted in <hi>Daniel.</hi> He had bene an exile a long tyme, and had bene toſſed with many and greuous ſtormes: yet doth he celebrate the prayſes of God. Which of vs can be ſo armed with pacience that he will prayſe God if he be vexed with great griefes and troubles but thrée or foure yeares? Yea ſcarce one day paſſeth ouer wherin our deſires do not ſo
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7787:113"/> boyle y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſome murmuring breaketh forth agaynſt God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng <hi>Daniel</hi> then could perſeuere in prayſing God whereas he was yet oppreſſed with ſo many griefes, ſorowes, &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes: this was a notable ſigne of inuincible patience. And without doubt hee ſignifieth a continuall action where he putteth that pronowne demonſtratiue <hi>[dena]</hi> which is referred to hys ordinary vſage, <hi>as hee dyd before of old tyme.</hi> When he noteth the tyme, he noteth (as I haue ſayd) a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, ſo that he vſed not to pray once or twiſe, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually euery day he exerciſed him ſelf in this godly exerciſe.</p>

Let them go now which will cloke their treaſon, whyles they pretend that men may not raſhly caſt them ſelues into daunger: and that, ſeyng wicked men lye in wayte for them on euery ſide, they are ware therfore that they do not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduiſedly caſt their lyues away. For <hi>Daniel</hi> by their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon were to be blamed of to much ſimplicitie and fooliſhnes, becauſe he went into knowne daunger wittingly and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly. Howbeit (as we haue ſayd) he could not haue eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped this daunger but he ſhould after a ſort haue fallen from God. For ſtraight way they would haue caſt him in the
<pb facs="tcp:7787:114"/> téeth: Wherfore doeſt thou leaue of from thy wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted maner? why ſhutteſt thou the wyndowes? why dareſt thou not boldly pray to thy GOD? It appeareth euidently that thou doeſt more eſteme the kyng then the reuerence and feare of God. Therfore <hi>Daniel</hi> becauſe the honour of God ſhould ſo haue bene diminiſhed, offereth him ſelfe as a ſacrifice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death willingly, as we haue ſayd.</p>
                     <p>We are taught alſo by this exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, that there be traynes prepared for the children of God continually, how circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly and modeſtly ſoeuer they behaue and order them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues. But they muſt behaue them ſelues ſo wiſely, that in the meane ſeaſon they be not ouer crafty or to much carefull: that is, that they do not ſo much prouide for their ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that in the meane ſeaſon they forget what God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and how precious his owne name is to him, and how neceſſary the confeſſion of fayth is in place and time.</p>

                        <hi>Daniel</hi> doth rehearſe firſt, that the king was troubled when he knew the malice of his nobles, which before he knew not. For he did not conſider what their purpoſe was, or what they went about. Now he ſéeth that he is deceaued and inta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gled: therfore is he troubled. Hereby we are taught agayne, how much kinges ought to take héede of wicked counſayle: becauſe they are ſet about on euery ſide by wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, who purpoſe no other thing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eyther to get gaine by falſe accuſations, or els to oppreſſe ſometymes their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, ſometime thoſe of whom they looke for ſome pray, and ſometyme to fauour wicked cauſes. Seyng then that kings are compaſſed about with ſo many traines, they muſt be ſo much the more diligent to take héede of their ſubtilties. For in the end they know that they are deceaued, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now there is no remedy: partly becauſe they feare their owne eſtate, &amp; partly becauſe they haue ſuch regard to their honor and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and had rather offend GOD then that men ſhould note them of any lightnes or vnconſtancy.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe therefore that kynges haue ſuch regard to their honor, it commeth thus to paſſe that they will go forward with thinges euill begonne, although their owne conſcience reproue them: and although equitie and iuſtice ſtand neuer
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7787:116"/> ſo cleare before their eyes, yet this can not be a bridle ſtrong enough when ambition doth cary them a contrary way, and they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not abide their name to be any whit impared before men. Such an example is ſet forth here vnto vs in <hi>Darius.</hi> For firſt it is ſayd, <hi>that he was heauy when he heard the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that he was carefull vnto the ſetting of the Sunne, how he might deliuer Daniel from death</hi> He was deſirous of thys in déede, if his honor and eſtimation might haue ſtand ſafe &amp; ſound, and alſo if the nobles had bene pleaſed. But whereas of the one ſide he feared daunger leſt the conſpiracy of the Princes might bréede ſome trouble, and of the other ſide he was moued wyth a fooliſh ſhamefaſtnes, becauſe he could not abide the reproch of inconſtancy which he feared: this is the cauſe that he being ouercome, did obey the luſtes of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Although then he laboured vntill the going downe of the Sunne to deliuer <hi>Daniel:</hi> yet that peruerſe ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtnes which I haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, and the feare of daunger pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed. For whenſoeuer we do not reſt vpon the helpe of God, we muſt of neceſſity alwayes wauer, although other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we be well affected and diſpoſed.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Pilate</hi> would haue deliuered Chriſt, but he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayd of the threatnings of the people whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they pronounced that <hi>Ceſar</hi> would be offended.<note place="margin">Ioh. 19.12.</note> And it is no meruaile though there be ſuch wauering where there is no beliefe nor reſting vpon God: For faith onely is the ſtable and ſure ſtay, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we reſt we may do our office without feare, and may ouercome all terrors. But where fayth fayleth, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wauering carieth vs to &amp; fro. And hereof co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth it that <hi>Darius</hi> feareth the conſpiracy of his nobles, and geueth vp innocent <hi>Daniel</hi> to their cruelty. There was alſo in him a ſhamefaſtnes which I haue ſpoken of, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would not ſéeme vnaduiſed or vnconſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which ſhould ſodainly call backe his decrée, ſeyng that it was a law amongeſt the <hi>Medes</hi> and the <hi>Perſians,</hi> that that which procéeded from the king myght not be repealed. And <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaketh furthermore of this, ſaying: <hi>that thoſe men gathered themſelues together,</hi> when they
<pb facs="tcp:7787:117"/> ſée that the kyng waxeth doubtfull and is ready, to chaunge his purpoſe: they rage and are ready, as it were, to fight with him.</p>
                     <p>Wheras they are named to haue aſſembled themſelues, it was to this purpoſe, to make king <hi>Darius</hi> afrayd. <hi>Know thou O king,</hi> ſay they. He knew it well enough, neyther do they teach hym a thing vnknowne: but they propound this as a threatning. What? doeſt thou not ſée that the kynges name ſhalbe of no authority hereafter, if this man ſhall vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late thy commaundement vnpuniſhed? Wilt thou ſuffer thy ſelfe ſo to be mocked? To conclude, they ſignifie that he ſhal not be king, except he reuenge the iniury done againſt hym by <hi>Daniel,</hi> which had deſpiſed the kinges commaundement. <hi>Know thou</hi> therfore, <hi>O king, that to the Medes and the Perſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</hi> He was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Medes:</hi> but it is as much as to ſay, what a rumor will be ſpred throughout all thy coaſtes? For thou knoweſt that this hath bene hetherto amongeſt the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> that the king ſhould not chaunge his ſtatutes. If thou then ſhew ſuch an example, wyll not all thy ſubiectes ſtraight way riſe agaynſt thee? ſhalt not thou be contemned of them? We ſée then how the Princes rage againſt theyr kyng, and do feare hym from the chaunging of his counſell. And they do ioyne the decrée to the ſtatute that the king had eſtabliſhed, to the entent that they may moue him the more, that he ſhould not ſuffer that to be contemned, that he had decréed and agayne eſtabliſhed.</p>

                     <p>The king (as I haue ſayd) beyng affrayd by the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng and manacing of his nobles, doth appoint <hi>Daniel</hi> to die. And hereby we gather that the kinges themſelues haue

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to obey like ſlaues vnto their flatterers. How was <hi>Darius</hi> deceaued by the craft of the Princes, euen becauſe he ſuppoſed, that his Empire ſhould be now eſtabliſhed, if he could thus trye the obedience of all men, that no man ſhould pray to any God for a whole moneth long? Therfore he thought, that he ſhould be both aboue God and man, if he had tryed ſuch an obedience in all his ſubiectes. Now we ſée how Princes do ſtubbernly riſe agaynſt God, when they dare threaten death, except men be obeyed.</p>
                     <p>We ſée then when kinges do extoll them ſelues ouer much, they ſet them ſelues forth to open ſhame: in ſo much that they be the ſlaues of their ſeruauntes. And this is ouer common in earthly princes. They which get great authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and fauour at their handes, do flatter them in all things, and they worſhip the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as Gods. There is no kinde of flattery which they do not inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues into fauour. But in the meane ſeaſon what libertie is there in thoſe Idoles? For they are ſuffred to do nothing: no, they can not be fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liare euen with their beſt and moſt faithful frendes, whiles they are obſerued and watched of their kepers. To conclude, if they be compared with thoſe miſerable perſons which are kept in moſt ſtrayte priſon, there is none ſhut vp in ſo déepe a dongeon, although he haue thrée or foure kepers, which hath not more libertie then theſe kynges. But (as I haue ſayd) this is the moſt iuſt iudgement and vengeance of God. For ſeyng they can not conteine them ſelues in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der &amp; degrée of men, but will pearce euen aboue the cloudes, and be equall with God, it is neceſſary that they be made a mocking ſtocke. Hereof it commeth that they are ſeruaunts to their ſeruauntes, and dare ſpeake nothing fréely, neither haue they any man their frende, neither dare they call this or that man vnto them, nor graunt vnto this man or that man what they would. Thus they rule therfore as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes in earthly kingdomes, becauſe they remember not that they are of the nomber of mortall men.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:7787:118"/>
                     <p>This came vpon king <hi>Darius</hi> becauſe he called <hi>Daniel,</hi> and by his commaundement was he caſt into the denne of Lyons: and his nobles do compell him to this wicked fact, and he obeyeth them agaynſt his will. But the cauſe hereof is to be noted, that whiles he forgot that he was a mortall man, and would extorte from God his dominion, as though he would plucke him downe from heauen. For if God be in heauen, he muſt be prayed vnto. But <hi>Darius</hi> did forbid that any man ſhould be ſo bold as to pray: and this was to make God of no power, as much as lay in him. But now is he compelled to obey euen his ſubiectes, although they exerciſe agaynſt him deſpitefull tyranny.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Daniel</hi> addeth, that the kyng ſpake thus to him: <hi>Thy God whom thou ſeruest,</hi> or whom thou worſhippeſt, <hi>hee will deliuer thee:</hi> This may be read as it were a wiſh or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and there is no doubt but <hi>Darius</hi> did ſo wiſh and deſire: but it may be taken alſo in this ſenſe: thy God whom thou worſhyppeſt will deliuer thée. As though he ſhould ſay: I haue no power now of my owne ſelfe: I am herein caryed away as with a raging tempeſt: my nobles compell me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt my will to this wicked fact. Now therfore I reſigne thée &amp; thy life into Gods hand, becauſe it is not in my power to deliuer thée: as though he would now make his crime the leſſe by this excuſe, becauſe he leaueth it in Gods power to to preſerue <hi>Daniel.</hi> This reaſon moueth ſome me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to prayſe the godlynes of the kyng. But as I graunt his pitie and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie to be ſhewed by theſe wordes: ſo is it plaine that there was not one crumme of godlynes in him when he would thus adorne him ſelfe with that which he robbeth from God. For ſuperſtitious men although they do not feare God aright, yet are they kept in ſome ſecrete feare of his maieſtie: but this man would haue brought to nothing all diuine power. What godlynes call you this? Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pitie or compaſſion may be prayſed in <hi>Darius,</hi> but his curſed pride can by no meanes be excuſed.</p>

                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:7787:118"/> Becauſe he had proued him to be a faithfull ſeruaunt. Wherfore this was a priuate loue which moued him to mercy. He would not haue ſhewed him ſelfe ſo fauorable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes others. If an hundreth or a thouſand <hi>Iewes</hi> had bene accuſed before him, he would haue conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned them all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any care, becauſe they had not obeyed this decrée. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that point he would haue ſhewed him ſelfe proude, ſtubborne, wicked, and cruell. But he ſpared <hi>Daniel</hi> for his owne priuate commoditie: agayne, becauſe he had receaued him to his fauour. But how ſoeuer his humanity is praiſed, there appeareth no ſigne of godlynes in hym. Yet he ſayth, <hi>Thy God whom thou doeſt worſhyp, he will deliuer thee,</hi> euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had knowne before how <hi>Daniel</hi> had prophecyed of the deſtruction of the Monarchy of the <hi>Chaldees.</hi> Hereby he is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uinced that the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> doth both know all things before, and alſo that all thinges are at his appointement. But in the meane ſeaſon neither doth he worſhyp him nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuffer him to be worſhipped of others: for he had robbed God of his authoritie as much as in him lay. Although then he do attribute here vnto God the power to deliuer, yet doth he it not from the bottome of his hart: and though he ſhould ſo do, his wickednes is ſo much the worſe when he depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him of his authoritie whom he perceaueth to be the true and onely God and of moſt high power, and yet beyng but earth and aſhes dare ſet him ſelfe vp in his place.</p>

                     <p>There is no doubt but this was done by the counſell of God, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nobles ſhould ſeale the ſtone with their ſignets, wherby the mouth of the denne was ſhut, to the intent that the miracle ſhould be the more manifeſt. For when on the
<pb facs="tcp:7787:119"/> next day the king came, the ſeales were whole, that is, the ſignets did remaine perfect. Hereby it appeareth that the ſeruaunt of God was ſaued, not by mans cunning, but by the helpe and power of God. In the meane ſeaſon we ſée how boldely the nobles compelled the king to all their purpoſes. For he might ſeme to haue done more then enough, when he deliuered vnto them a faithfull man that was deare vnto him, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he commaunded him to be caſt into the denne of Lyons: yet they be not content with this tractablenes of the king that is ſo eaſily entreated, but they do force one thing further, that is, that the mouth of the denne ſhould be ſhut: then do they all ſeale the ſtone, leſt any man ſhould take <hi>Daniel</hi> away.</p>
                     <p>We ſée then when libertie is once taken away, there is no end: eſpecially when any man is made a ſeruaunt or ſlaue by his owne fault, or hath geuen him ſelfe vp to the will of wicked men. For at the firſt ſo great a bondage ſhall not preuaile, that he which ſemeth to be frée, ſhould be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to do this or that, or what ſoeuer is commaunded: but when he hath once geuen him ſelfe to bondage and ſlauery (as I haue ſayd euen now) he is compelled to ſinne agayne and agayne, and without end and meaſure. For example: if any man haue declined and fallen from his dutie either by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feare of man or by flattery, or any other corrupt affection, he will agrée to this thing or that, when he ſhall not be onely entreated but by importunitie compelled: but when he hath once altogether abandoned his libertie (as I haue ſayd) he ſhall be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled euen to admitte moſt ſhamefull thinges at euery mans pleaſure. Let a man be a paſtor or preacher in the Church, let him once decline of the one ſide or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through ambition or the like vice: he that hath brought hym ſo farre, will come to him the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d tyme and ſay: what? dareſt thou deny me this? haue not I obteined of thée yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day and the other day this and that? So ſhall he be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled the ſecond time to treſpaſſe for his fauour to whom he hath bound him ſelfe, and the third time ſhall he be compelled to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7787:119"/> do ſo and to the end, yea without end.</p>
                     <p>So alſo princes which are not onely frée but rule ouer other, if they ſuffer them ſelues to be ouercome with an euil conſcience, they geue away from them ſelues all authoritie and are drawen euery way as pleaſeth their ſubiectes. Ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore this example is ſet before vs in kyng <hi>Darius,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he had appointed <hi>Daniel</hi> to vniuſt puniſhment, he addeth this alſo: <hi>that the denne might be ſhut:</hi> and alſo, <hi>that the ſtone might be ſealed.</hi> And to what end? forſooth, <hi>that the decree might not be chaunged,</hi> that is, that he might not be bold to attempt any thing about <hi>Daniel.</hi> We ſée therefore what great ignominy and ſhame the kyng bringeth him ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, for that his nobles do firſt take from him all credite, as though they did deny that they would beleue him although he commaunded <hi>Daniel</hi> to be caſt into the denne of Lyons, but did require an aſſuraunce, that he ſhould not take him away: neither would they ſuffer any thing to be attempted of him in that point. We ſée therfore how ſhamefully they diſcredit their king. Againe we ſée how they chalenge autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ouer him, that he ſhould not take vpon him to lift vp the ſtone which was ſealed, vnleſſe he would be counted a falſe man, as one that breaketh publicke decrées and viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth publicke recordes, and hath no truth in him.</p>
                     <p>This place therfore doth admoniſh vs that we geue not vp our ſelues to the luſtes of men and vnto ſeruile bondage. Let euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſerue his neighbours as much as charitie bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him and as their neceſſitie requireth. But in the meane ſeaſon let no man by corrupt conſcience be turned this way or that way: for when he ceaſeth to be at libertie, hee ſhalbe compelled to beare all maner of ſhame and ignominy, &amp; to obey moſt filthy commaundements: like as we ſée it come to paſſe in baudes and other wicked perſons which ſerue the luſtes and couetouſnes of their princes, or their ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and cruelty. For when they are brought once into bondage, they are moſt miſerable ſlaues, neither can they auoyde extreme vilanyes, but they muſt ſerue with ſhame, and prouoke both

                     <p>Wherefore <hi>Darius</hi> is ſet forth here vnto vs as one in a meane ſtate betwixt the wicked reprobates, and the vpright and conſtant worſhippers of God. The wicked doubt not to prouoke God againſt them, and they are diſſolute in their luſtes and concupiſcence, caſting of all ſhame and feare.

Of this ſort was <hi>Darius.</hi> For where he ought conſtantly to haue reproued the falſe accuſation of the nobles, and ſhould boldly haue withſtand them, and rebuked them that they ſo abuſed hys gentlenes: when he ſaw himſelfe entangled by them, he was ſo farre from ſo doing, that he rather obeyed their fury.

                        <hi>The king came vnto the graue and ſayth: Daniel, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt of the liuing God, thy God whom thou alwayes worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest, can he not deliuer thee? <hi>Darius</hi>
                        </hi> nameth the God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liuing God. But if there be one liuing God, he ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out all the imagined and fayned Gods which men haue deuiſed by their owne brayne. For of neceſſity there can be but one Godhead: and this principle prophane me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo haue confeſſed. And though euery one do fall afterward after hys owne dreames, yet they all agrée in this, that there can not be many Gods. They diuide God, as it were into parts: but they can not deny this, that there is one onely God. <hi>Darius</hi> therefore when he geueth this title to the God of Iſrael, he confeſſeth all other Gods to be mere fantaſies: but he doth not vnderſtand this point (as I haue ſayd) that prophane
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7787:121"/> do holde this principle, but yet vaniſh away afterward in their owne imaginations. Therefore this place doth not proue, as ſome thinke, that king <hi>Darius</hi> was truely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo that he receaued and embraced true piety and Godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. For he alway worſhipped his Idoles: but he thought that this was ſufficient, that he left the higheſt place for the God of Iſrael. But, as we know,<note place="margin">Iſay. 42.8</note> God can ſuffer no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, for he is zelous of his glory. It was a fond thyng ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that <hi>Darius</hi> did acknowledge that God which <hi>Daniel</hi> did worſhip, to excell all other Gods. For where God raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, of neceſſity all Idols come to nought: as it is ſayd alſo in the Pſalme: <hi>God raigneth, let all the Gods of the nations fall.</hi> Therefore <hi>Darius</hi> had not ſo much profited that hee would geue himſelfe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true and onely God: albeit he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to geue the greateſt honour to the God of Iſraell: yet in the meane ſeaſon he alwayes ſtoode drowned in his owne ſuperſtitions wherunto he was accuſtomed.</p>
                     <p>Afterward he addeth: <hi>Thy God whom thou worſhyppest al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, could not he deliuer thee from the Lyons?</hi> He ſpeaketh here doubtfully, as vnbeleuers are wont to do, which ſeme to them ſelues to beleue, but they haue nothing ſtable nor ſounde in their mindes. Prayer is naturall (that I might ſo ſpeake:) that is, a certaine ſecret motion doth driue men na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally to fly vnto God: but becauſe ſcarce the hundreth ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth reſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word of God, hereby it commeth that they call vpon God at aduenture. Therefore they will try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God will helpe them or ayde their neceſſities: in the meane ſeaſon (as I haue ſayd) there is no ſure perſuaſion in their hartes. Such was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of kyng <hi>Darius: <hi>Could not God deliuer thee,</hi>
                        </hi> ſaith he? as though the power of God were to be doubted of. If he ſhould haue ſayd: hath God deliuered thée? this had bene tolerable. For God is not bounde by any law to deliuer his ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes alway fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death, as it is well enough knowne: but that is in his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d whether he will do it or no.

Therfore he firſt ſetteth forth the vnitie of God, and afterward he addeth that the angels are ready to helpe his ſeruauntes: but yet they ſo do it as they were commaunded. So the whole prayſe of all ſafetie doth belong to God alone: becauſe the angels do not helpe whom they will, neither are they moued by their owne will, but onely obey Gods commaundement.</p>
                     <p>We muſt note that thing alſo which foloweth: <hi>That God dyd ſtop the mouthes of the Lyons.</hi> For the Prophet tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth by theſe wordes, that both Lyons and the moſt cruell beaſtes are in Gods power, &amp; are ruled by his ſecret bridle, ſo that they do not rage nor do any harme but as God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth.

We ſée al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo how all the wicked do imagine our deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; how furiouſly they rage againſt vs. But God which can ſtop the mouthes of the Lyons, will alſo bridle the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and all the wicked, that they ſhall not in any wiſe hurt vs but by his permiſſion. Yea experience doth teach vs that the deuill and all the wicked are repreſſed by his hand. For we ſhould periſh euery moment, but that God by his power turneth away innumerable daungers which hang ouer our heades. Let vs therfore know that it is by the ſingulare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of God, that we remaine ſafe euen one day in ſo great rage and madnes of our enemyes.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer <hi>Daniel</hi> ſayth, that the Lyons did him no hurt at all, <hi>becauſe righteouſnes before God was founde in him.</hi> By the which wordes he ſignifieth that he was therfore preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, becauſe God would maintaine his glory and worſhyp which he had commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by his law. Neither doth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet here proudly extoll his iuſtice, but rather ſheweth that he was therefore deliuered, becauſe God would teſtifie by a certaine and euident declaration that that worſhyp was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, for the which <hi>Daniel</hi> did fight euen vnto death. We ſée therfore how <hi>Daniel</hi> referreth all thinges to the ſetting forth of the true worſhip of God. The ſumme is, that he was the patron of a holy and godly cauſe, and that he was ready to ſuffer death, not by any fooliſh imagination, or ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den motion, or confuſed zeale: but becauſe hee was ſurely perſuaded that he worſhipped the liuing God. Therfore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was the mainteiner of a holy and godly cauſe, hee ſayth that he was preſerued. This is the ſumme.</p>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:7787:123"/>
                     <p>Hereby we may eaſily gather how fooliſh the Papiſtes are, which by this place &amp; ſuch like go about to ſet vp the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice &amp; merites of workes. <hi>Daniel</hi> (ſay they) was preſerued becauſe iuſtice was founde in him before God: therfore God geueth to euery one according to the merites of his workes. But firſt we muſt marke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purpoſe of <hi>Daniel.</hi> For he doth not boaſt of his merites (as I haue ſayd): but he would that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deliueraunce offered him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen ſhould be a witnes of the true and pure worſhip of God, that he might make king <hi>Darius</hi> aſhamed, and that he might ſhew that all ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are wicked, eſpecially that he might admoniſh him of that ſacrilegious decrée, wherby hee did arrogate vnto him ſelfe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> higheſt dominion, ſo that he aboliſhed as much as lay in him, the whole deitie. Therefore that the Prophet might admoniſh the kyng hereof, he ſaith that his cauſe was iuſt.</p>
                     <p>And that the ſolution may bee the more eaſie, we muſt note that there is a difference betwixt eternall ſaluation and ſpeciall deliueraunces. God doth deliuer vs from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death, and doth chuſe vs vnto the hope of eternall life, not becauſe hee findeth any righteouſnes in vs, but becauſe he hath choſen vs fréely: and therfore doth he make perfect in vs his worke without any reſpect of workes. Therefore for as much as belongeth to eternall ſaluation, there can be no reſpect of iuſtice, becauſe when God will ſearch vs, he ſhall finde nothing but cauſe of damnation. But as concernyng particulare deliueraunces, there God can looke on euery mans iuſtice: not that it is our owne: but whom he gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with his ſpirite that they may obey his vocation, to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo he reacheth forth his hand, and if they be in ieoperdy for that they ſtudy to obey him, he deliuereth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This is as if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould ſay, that God fauoreth good cauſes: but this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth nothing to merites. Therefore as concerning this place, the Papiſtes dote ouer childiſhly, which do thereby gather merites. For <hi>Daniel</hi> meaneth no other thyng but to maintaine the pure worſhip of the onely God: as though he ſhould ſay, that God did not onely make a counte of him, but
<pb facs="tcp:7787:124"/> that there was an other cauſe of his deliueraunce, that is, becauſe God would ſhew in dede and by experience that his cauſe was iuſt.</p>
                     <p>He addeth: <hi>and alſo before thee O king I haue commited no wickednes.</hi> It is certayne that the Prophet did violate the kynges commaundement. Wherefore then doth he not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly confeſſe this? yea why doth he affirme that he had not treſpaſſed againſt the king? Verely becauſe he had faithfully behaued himſelfe and ſerued the king iuſtly and vprightly in all thinges, he might purge himſelfe of the ſclaunder wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was charged, that he had deſpiſed the kinges com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. For <hi>Daniel</hi> was not ſo bound vnto the kyng of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> but that God might chalenge vnto himſelfe that which can not be taken from him.</p>
                     <p>We know that earthly Empires are ordayned of God, but vnder this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould loſe nothing of his right, but that hee alone ſhould haue the preeminence aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that all Maieſtrates and rulers, and whatſoeuer is hygh in the world, ſhould bee brought vnder and be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to his glory. Becauſe therefore <hi>Daniel</hi> might not obey the kinges decrée vnleſſe he denyed God (as we haue ſéene before) he treſpaſſed not againct the kyng when he went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conſtantly in that exerciſe of holynes whereunto hee had accuſtomed himſelfe, that is, in praying vnto God thriſe a day. And that this may be more euident, that ſentence of <hi>Peter</hi> muſt be remembred: <hi>feare God, honour the king.</hi> Theſe two are ioyned together, ſo that the one can not be ſeparate from the other. Wherefore the feare of God muſt go before, that kinges may obtayne their authority. For if any man beginne at the reuerence of an earthly prince, ſetting God aſide, he doth wickedly: for this were to peruert the whole order of nature. Therefore let God be feared firſt of all: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> let earthly Princes enioy their authority: yet in ſuch ſort that God be preferred aboue all (as I haue ſayd). <hi>Daniel</hi> therefore doth defend himſelfe by Gods right, that he had
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7787:124"/> committed no treſpaſſe againſt the king, euen becauſe he beyng compelled to obey the commaundement of God, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed that which the king commaunded on the contrary. For earthly Princes depriue themſelues of all authority when they riſe vp againſt God, yea they are vnworthy to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted amongeſt the company of men. We ought rather to ſpit in their faces, then to obey them when they deale ſo proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſtubbernly, that they will ſpoyle God of his right, and as it were occupy hys throne, as though they could plucke hym downe from heauen. This is the ſenſe of this place.</p>

Therefore God did declare his power, that <hi>Daniel</hi> eſcaped ſo ſafe that the Lyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s did not touch him. Doubtles he ſhould haue bene torne in péeces if God had not ſhut the Lyons mouthes: but this alſo did make very much for the amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng of the miracle, that no hurt was fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpon his body nor any ſigne that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lyons had once touched him. Therfore that the Lyons did ſo ſpare hym, it was done by the ſecret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God. And this was alſo more manifeſtly knowne whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hys falſe accuſers were caſt into the denne, becauſe they
<pb facs="tcp:7787:125"/> were ſtraight way torne in péeces and deuoured of the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as we will ſhew hereafter.</p>
                     <p>But the reaſon is to be noted which is added: <hi>that he was preſerued, becauſe he did beleue in his God.</hi> For many tymes we ſée that ſome man maintayneth a good cauſe, and yet it hath very euill ſucceſſe, becauſe he taketh in hand to do that by his owne wiſdome, policy, and induſtry, which otherwiſe were worthy ſome commendation. It is no meruaile then though they be many times deſtitute of good ſucceſſe, which yet vndertake to mayntayne good cauſes: as appeareth in al prophane perſons. For the hiſtories of all ages do ſhew that often tymes euen they which haue taken in hand good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, haue periſhed: which came to paſſe by the wicked confidence that they had in themſelues, euen becauſe they were not bent to ſerue God, but rather ſought prayſe and worldly fame: Wherefore, as ambition caried them away, ſo alſo they flattered themſelues in their owne counſailes.</p>
                     <p>And hereof came that ſaying of <hi>Brutus,</hi> that vertue was but a vayne thing, becauſe he thought that he was euill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated when he had fought for the maintenaunce of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet found the Gods not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable but angry againſt hym. As though forſooth that God were bound to helpe him, which neither truſted in him nor craued his helpe. For we know what a proud ſtomacke that man had. I bring forth one example: but if we diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weigh what hath cauſed all prophane men ſo ſtoutly to fight euen in good cauſes, we ſhall finde that ambition was the chiefe cauſe that moued them. No meruayle then though God did forſake them at the very pinch, becauſe they were vnworthy to féele his helpe. Thus <hi>Daniel</hi> expreſſeth that he was preſerued ſafe becauſe hee beleued in his GOD. And the Apoſtle did meane this in the eleuenth chapter to the <hi>Hebrues,</hi> when he ſayth that ſome were ſaued or deliuered from the mouth of the Lyons by fayth. Therefore he noteth the cauſe why <hi>Daniel</hi> was preſerued, and he ſtirreth vs vp vnto fayth.</p>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:7787:125"/>
                     <p>But here muſt we learne what force is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of <hi>Bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng,</hi> and what it doth conteine in it. For the Prophet doth not ſimply ſay that he was preſerued becauſe that he bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true &amp; onely God, the maker of heauen and earth: but becauſe hee committed his life vnto God, becauſe he reſted wholly vppon his grace, becauſe he aſſured him ſelf moſt certainely, that he could haue none other but a happy end if he ſerued him. Becauſe therefore that <hi>Daniel</hi> was certainly perſuaded that his life was in the hand of God, and that he did not truſt in him in vayne, and that he did ieopard him ſelfe boldly &amp; without all feare for the true worſhip of God: therfore he ſayth, <hi>that he beleued in God.</hi> We ſée therfore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this word of <hi>Beleuing</hi> is not taken ſo barely as the Papiſtes do dreame: for hereof came that fond imagination of their implicate and intricate faith, and of the dead faith, or faith without forme: for they ſuppoſe that faith is nothing els but a confuſed conceiuyng of the Godhead. When we conceiue then that there is a God, the Papiſtes do counte it to be faith. But the holy ghoſt doth teach vs farre otherwiſe. For we muſt remember that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtle, that we do not beleue God aright, vnleſſe we be perſuaded that he is the rewarded of al that ſéeke him. Wherfore this perſuaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is included in faith,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> that God doth not deceaue his worſhippers.</p>
                     <p>Now we muſt marke the maner of ſeking God. God ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ſought not by any fooliſh arrogancy, as though we could by our merites binde him vnto vs: but he is ſought by faith, he is ſought by humility, he is ſought by prayer. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we know this, that God is the rewarder of all thoſe that ſeke him: &amp; that we know how he muſt be ſought, this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true faith. So <hi>Daniel</hi> doubted not but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God would be his deliuerer, becauſe he was fully perſuaded of that true Religion which he had learned of a child, and whereunto he fully truſting, called vpon God continually. This was then the cauſe of his deliueraunce. In the meane time, it is certaine yet that <hi>Daniel</hi> did not beleue God as though hee
<pb facs="tcp:7787:126"/> had bene already inſtructed of the end and ſucceſſe. For he rather committeth his life vnto God, becauſe he was ready to dye. Therfore <hi>Daniel</hi> could not know this before he was caſt into the denne and deliuered vnto the Lyons, whether God would deliuer him, as we haue alſo ſene before in his felowes: <hi>God if he will, can deliuer vs, but if not we are ready to worſhyp him, and we will not obey thy commaundement.</hi> And if <hi>Daniel</hi> had bene taught before of that which did come to paſſe afterward, his conſtantnes had ben worthy of no great prayſe: but becauſe hee would boldly ſuffer death for the true worſhip of his God, and could deny him ſelfe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the world, this is a true and vndoubted proofe of his faith and conſtancy. Therfore he beleued in God, not that he hoped for ſuch a miracle: but becauſe he knew that hee ſhould be happy if he remained ſtedfaſt in the pure worſhip of God: Euen as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth: <hi>Chriſt is to me aduauntage both in life and death.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 1.21.</note> Therfore <hi>Daniel</hi> reſteth wholly vppon the helpe of God, and ſhutteth his eyes as concernyng the ende that ſhould folow: neither was he ouer carefull for his lyfe, but becauſe his minde was lifted vp to the hope of a better life, therefore although hee ſhould haue dyed an hundreth deathes, yet would not he ceaſe to beleue. For our belefe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth it ſelfe beyond the boundes of this tranſitory and corruptible life, as is well knowne to all the godly.</p>

We ſée then how God doth ſwage the cruelty of the Lyons when it ſéemeth good vnto him: but he ſtirreth them vp to rage when he wyll puniſh men.</p>
                     <p>And whereas the wiues and their children were caſt into the denne, we muſt not curiouſly diſpute whether this was a iuſt puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or no. For it ſéemeth that this is a certaine rule of equity, that the puniſhment ſhould not extend to the giltles, eſpecially when it ſtandeth vpon the loſſe of life. For although at all tymes this was receaued in well ordered Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that many puniſhmentes were layd vpon the children together with the parentes, like as in murther and in trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, where all the goods were publikely ſold: &amp; alſo in crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall iudgementes the infamy of the parentes did redounde vnto their children: yet this is more ſtrait and ſeuere, to kill the children together with their parents, ſeyng they can not be gilty of the ſame crimes. But although this be not very
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7787:127"/> vſuall, yet is it not lawfull for vs ſimply to condemne it. We ſée how God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth whole families to be vtterly deſtroyed, to ſhew how much ſinne is to be deteſted and abhorred: and God as he is a iuſt iudge, doth alway kéepe a meaſure in his ſeuerity. Therefore this example can not be preciſely condemned, but it is better to leaue this at liberty. For we know that the kinges of the Eaſt part did exerciſe cruell and barbarous dominion or rather tyranny towards their ſubiectes. Therefore there is no cauſe why any man ſhould contend much about this queſtion. It greued king <hi>Darius</hi> that he was ſo deceaued. Therefore he doth not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute puniſhment vpon the wicked accuſers, onely becauſe <hi>Daniel</hi> was wickedly oppreſſed of them, but becauſe they did hym iniury.

<pb facs="tcp:7787:128"/> hereby to be of ſound religion, as many interpreters do here commend king <hi>Darius</hi> aboue meaſure, as though he had bene wholy conuerted and had receaued the true worſhip preſcribed in the law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> No ſuch thing can be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the wordes of the decrée: and the matter it ſelfe doth declare, that hys dominion and kingdome was neuer pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from ſuperſtitions. For king <hi>Darius</hi> ſuffered hys ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes to ſerue Idoles, and he himſelfe ceaſed not to be pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with ſuch filthines: but he would place the God of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> in the hieſt degrée, as though he could couple together fire and water: of the which thing we haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before. For the prophane men thinke that they do their duty to the true God, if they do not altogether contemne hym, but appoynt him ſome place: but eſpecially when they preferre hym a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all the Idols, they thinke that they haue ſatiſfied God. But this is fooliſh. For except all ſuperſtitions be aboliſhed, God hath not his right, for he ſuffereth no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this place doth not ſhew that there was any true or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Religion in kyng <hi>Darius:</hi> but we may onely gather hereby, that hee was moued with this miracle, to this ende that hee ſhould celebrate throughout all nations that were ſubiect vnto him, the glory and name of the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To conclude, as it was but a particulare motion of kyng <hi>Darius:</hi> ſo he went not beyond this particulare affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he thoroughly acknowledge the power &amp; goodnes of God: but tooke hold of that onely which was before his eyes. Therfore he could not generally know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that he might giue him ſelf to true &amp; ſincere pietie: but (as I haue ſayd) he would haue him to remaine amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the other Gods, and to be ouer them: but ſo that he ſhould not be alone. But God doth refuſe this halfe worſhip. Therefore there is no cauſe why <hi>Darius</hi> ſhould ſo much be prayſed. Yet ſhall he condemne all thoſe by his example, which at this day do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe them ſelues either Catholicke kynges, or Chriſtians, or defenders of the faith, and in the meane ſeaſon do not onely oppreſſe true Religion, but alſo as much as in them
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7787:128"/> lyeth, do ouerthrow the whole worſhip of God, &amp; would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyngly aboliſh his name out of the world: exerciſyng tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny agaynſt all the godly, and eſtabliſhyng wicked ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thorough their crueltie. <hi>Darius</hi> ſhalbe a worthy iudge vnto them: and this decrée which <hi>Daniel</hi> rehearſeth ſhal ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to condemne all ſuch.</p>
                     <p>Now hee ſayth: <hi>That this decree was written to all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nations and languages that dwelled in all the earth.</hi> We ſée that <hi>Darius</hi> would not onely haue the power of GOD knowne to the people which were nere him, but he did ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to declare it farre and wyde. Therfore hee did not onely publiſh it in writyng thoroughout all <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Chaldea,</hi> but euen amongeſt the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians.</hi> Albeit he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer reigned in <hi>Perſia:</hi> but becauſe his ſonne in law had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him into the ſocietie of the Empire, his authoritie dyd alſo extend ſo farre. And thus ought it to be vnderſtand whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſayth, <hi>thorow the whole earth.</hi> For it is not ſpoken of the whole world, but of that Monarchy which was ſpread al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt throughout the Eaſt. For the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> bare rule from the Sea vnto <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Seyng then the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was ſo large, <hi>Daniel</hi> doth not without cauſe ſay that the decrée was proclamed throughout the earth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Peace be multiplied vnto you.</hi> We know that kynges do thus faune vpon their ſubiectes, and vſe gentle prefaces that they may more eaſily obteine their purpoſes, and alſo that they may haue them more obedient ſubiectes. And this is a thyng that coſteth them nought, to wiſh peace to their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes. And in the meane tyme (as I haue ſayd) by this bayte they do often times ſéeke fauour to prepare their ſubiectes to further bondage. By the name of peace it is wel knowen that a proſperous ſtate is vnderſtand: as though hee ſhould ſay, I wiſhe you to do well and proſperouſly.</p>
                     <p>Afterward hee addeth: <hi>That a decree is made in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> that is to ſay, that he of his authoritie doth comman<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de all his ſubiectes: <hi>that they all do feare and tremble before the God of Daniel.</hi> By the which feare and tremblyng he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth
<pb facs="tcp:7787:129"/> nothyng but reuerence and worſhip. But thus vſe all prophane me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſpeake, which are afrayde at the naming of God. Yet it ſemeth that he would expreſſe that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was euident, which ought to moue them all to reuerence and worſhip him, and that with feare and trembling. And this maner of ſpeach ſemeth to be taken of a true principle: becauſe God is neuer truly worſhipped but when men are humbled and brought downe. Therfore God nameth him ſelfe many tymes terrible: not that he would driue his ſeruauntes to worſhip him by feare: but becauſe (as I haue ſayd) the mindes of men can neuer be well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to due reuerence, vnleſſe they fully perceaue the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, ſo that they are afrayde of his iudgement. But if feare onely ſhould haue place in the mindes of men, he could not frame them to true holines. For that ſentence of the Pſalme<note place="margin">Pſal. 130.</note> is to be conſidered: <hi>There is mercy with thee, that thou mayeſt be feared.</hi> God can not therfore be rightly worſhipped or feared, vnleſſe we be perſuaded that hee wilbe entreated, and that we be ſure that he wilbe mercyfull vnto vs. Yet is it neceſſary that feare and tremblyng go before, which may humble and bring downe the pride of the fleſh. This is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by theſe wordes: <hi>That all may feare and tremble before the God of Daniel.</hi> The king calleth him the God of <hi>Daniel,</hi> not that <hi>Daniel</hi> had made him, but becauſe he worſhipped him. We may rightly ſay that <hi>Iupiter</hi> is the God of the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> becauſe he was made a God by their fooliſhnes, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by gate his name and authoritie in the reſidue of the world. And ſo <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Minerua</hi> and that multitude of the falſe Gods take their names of their originall.</p>
                     <p>There is an other cauſe why king <hi>Darius</hi> calleth him the God of <hi>Daniel</hi> whom <hi>Daniel</hi> worſhipped: becauſe hee reueled him ſelfe to <hi>Daniel:</hi> as he is called the God of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> becauſe hee reueled him ſelfe vnto <hi>Abraham.</hi> But to explicate this thing more manifeſtly: why is hee called the God of <hi>Daniel,</hi> rather then the God of the <hi>Babylonians?</hi> Doubtles becauſe <hi>Daniel,</hi> as hee had learned by the law of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7787:129"/> 
                        <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo did hee worſhip God purely, which had made his conuenaunt with <hi>Abraham</hi> and the holy fathers, and which had adopted the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for a peculiare people vnto him ſelfe. This did therfore depend of the worſhip preſcribed in the law, and the worſhip did depend of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> couenaunt. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the name of <hi>Daniel</hi> is not put here as though he had libertie to fayne or imagine a God: but becauſe he worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that God that had reueled him ſelfe by his word. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this maner of ſpeach muſt be thus vnderſtand, that all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt feare that God that hath made his couenaunt with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his poſteritie, and which hath choſen that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as a peculiar people to him ſelfe, who hath taught the maner and forme of the true and right worſhip, and hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it by his law, and whom alſo <hi>Daniel</hi> worſhipped.</p>
                     <p>Therefore let vs learne to diſcerne the true God from all Idols and mens fantaſies, if we deſire to haue our ſeruice and worſhip allowed before him. For many imagine that they worſhip God which yet do wander in all kinde of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and are not addicted to one true God. This is a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked thing, yea it is nothyng but a prophanation of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſo confuſedly to worſhip God. Therefore we muſt marke this difference which I haue ſpoken of, that our mindes may euer bee kept within the boundes of the word (leſt we erre from the true God) if ſo be we couet to reteine him and to folow the Religion that hee alloweth. I ſay, that we muſt abide within the boundes of the word, and may neither decline hether nor thether: for we ſhall fall into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable deceites of the deuill, vnleſſe the word kepe vs, as it were faſt bound vnto it. As concerning <hi>Darius,</hi> he did know that there was one moſt high God: but (as is ſayd before) he did not caſt away his fayned and wicked Religion wherunto he was accuſtomed. But ſuch mixture of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is intolerable before God.</p>
                     <p>He addeth: <hi>Becauſe he is the liuyng God and remaineth for euer.</hi> Here he ſemeth to bring all the falſe Gods to nothing. But (as I ſayd) all prophane men do ſo lift vp their mindes
<pb facs="tcp:7787:130"/> to the moſt high God, that yet by and by after they vaniſh away. Therefore if they did acknowledge the true God aright, they would immediatly exclude all fayned Gods. But they thinke it enough if God haue the firſt place, and in the meane ſeaſon they ioyne leſſer Gods to him, that he may lie hid as it were amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt the number, and yet haue ſome kinde of préeminence.</p>
                     <p>Such was the reaſon and ſuch was the purpoſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius:</hi> for hee vnderſtode nothing purely and ſincerely of the onely eſſence of God, but ſuppoſed the moſt hye power to be in the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> how ſoeuer other nations worſhipped their Gods. So do we ſée that hee departed not from the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which he had receiued in his childhode. Wherfore there is no cauſe why we ſhould prayſe his godlynes, ſaue onely in this particular action. Yet God doth wraſt forth of his mouth a confeſſion, wherin his nature is deſcribed vnto vs. He calleth him <hi>the liuing God,</hi> not onely becauſe he hath lyfe in him ſelfe but alſo of himſelf, &amp; becauſe he is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and originall of life. Wherfore this adiectiue muſt be taken actiuely, becauſe God doth not onely liue, but he hath life alſo of him ſelfe: agayne, he is the cauſe of life, becauſe there is no life beſide him or without him.</p>
                     <p>Afterward hee addeth: <hi>That he remaineth for euer:</hi> and ſo doth he diſſeuer him from all creatures, amongeſt whom there is nothyng ſtable nor ſtedfaſt. For we do know that not onely euery thyng which is vnder the heauen is ſubiect to chaunges, but alſo the heauen it ſelfe. In this point ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth God differre from all creatures, that he ſuffreth no chaunge, but is alway in one ſtate.</p>
                     <p>He addeth: <hi>That his kingdome is not corrupted, and that hys domination is for euer.</hi> Here doth hee more clearely expreſſe that which he ſpake before of the conſtant ſtabilitie of God, that he doth not onely remaine in his owne eſſence, but that he exerciſeth his power throughout the world, and that hee gouerneth the world by his power and ſuſteineth all things. For if hee had ſayd no more but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God remaineth for euer,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7787:130"/> as we are wicked, and alſo weake of vnderſtanding, we ſhould onely conceaue this opinion of God, that in his owne eſſence he is ſubiect to no chaunge: but his power which is ſpread in euery place, we ſhould not vnderſtand. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication then is worthy to be noted when <hi>Darius</hi> doth plainely expreſſe, <hi>that the kingdome of God is not corrupted, but his dominion is for euer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Agayne, he calleth GOD <hi>the deliuerer.</hi> They that take hold of this word as an excellent, teſtimony of godlynes, ſay that <hi>Darius</hi> ſpake like an Euangeliſt, and that hee was a preacher of Gods mercy: but (as I haue ſayd) <hi>Darius</hi> neuer receaued generally that which the Scripture teacheth, that is to ſay, that God doth mercyfully cheriſh all his and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth them, becauſe he is mercyfull and becauſe he beſtoweth vpon them his fatherly fauour. Kyng <hi>Darius</hi> vnderſtode not this cauſe. The deliueraunce of <hi>Daniel</hi> was knowne, which was a particular document of Gods grace.</p>
                     <p>Thus did <hi>Darius</hi> onely perceaue in particular, that God was mercifull to his ſeruauntes &amp; ready to ſaue &amp; to deliuer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But this were but a ſlender matter vnleſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe were alſo adioyned, that God is therefore a deliuerer, becauſe he hath vouchedſafe to chuſe his ſeruauntes and becauſe he hath teſtified that he wyll be a father vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe he is fauourable and mercifull, and pardoneth them when they haue ſinned. Vnleſſe therefore that the hope of the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce be grounded in the frée adoption of God and in hys mercy, it will be but a particular knowledge without force. <hi>Darius</hi> then doth not here ſpeake as one truely and purely inſtructed of the mercy of God, but he onely ſayth that he is the deliuerer of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be his. In déede he rightly concludeth this generall ſentence: <hi>that God is a deliuerer,</hi> becauſe he hath deliuered <hi>Daniel</hi> from the power and rage of the Lyons. For of one example he deriueth a more large doctrine, that it is in Gods power to ſaue and to deliuer his as oft as he pleaſeth: and in the meane tyme, he knowledgeth the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power of God in one act and miracle, but he knoweth
<pb facs="tcp:7787:131"/> not the principall cauſe nor the fountaine, which was that God embraced <hi>Daniel</hi> like as the other children of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and of his fatherly fauour preſerued hym.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore that this doctrine may be profitable vnto vs, and may moue our myndes effectually, that God is the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerer: firſt let vs firmely truſt, that we are receaued into hys fauour of this condition, that he wyll pardon vs our faultes, and not treat vs as we deſerue, but for his infinite mercy will fauour vs as children. This the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. Laſt of all he ſaith: <hi>that God doth worke miracles &amp; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in heauen and in earth.</hi> This muſt be referred to the Empire and dominion whereof he ſpake a litle before. But <hi>Darius</hi> alway doth remayne in the preſent miracle before hys eyes. He had ſéene that <hi>Daniel</hi> remayned ſafe amongeſt the Lyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: he had ſéene al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other torne in péeces. Theſe were manifeſt tokens of Gods power. He ſaith therfore not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, that he wrought miracles &amp; wonders. And there is no doubt but that <hi>Darius</hi> was admoniſhed alſo of other ſignes and wonders which were done before that he obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that Monarchy. For he had heard doubtles, all that was done to the king <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> and to king <hi>Beltſazar,</hi> whom <hi>Darius</hi> himſelf ſlue to haue his kingdome. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he collecteth moe teſtimonies of Gods power by this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, that he had ſet forth his glory in that worke when he deliuered <hi>Daniel.</hi> To conclude, if <hi>Darius</hi> had renounced his ſuperſtitions, this had bene a pure, true, and alſo a full confeſſion of true religion: but becauſe he ceaſed not to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip falſe Gods, and did ſtill ſticke to his accuſtomed filthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, therefore can not his godlines be commended, neither can a true and earneſt conuerſion be collected by this decrée. This is the matter to be conſhdered.</p>

                     <p>Here is an <hi>antitheſis</hi> ſecretly touched betwixt the ſtate of <hi>Daniel</hi> vnder the two Monarchies, the <hi>Perſians</hi> and the <hi>Chaldees.</hi> For <hi>Daniel</hi> did ſometymes riſe vp vnder <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezer,</hi> and in the end when this Monarchy was at the point of deſtruction, he began to be knowne agayne: but all that tyme that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Chaldees</hi> raigned, he was vnknowne and deſpiſed. All men had heard that he was an excellent Prophet: but he was caſt forth of the Court: and though he ſometyme had ſitten at the kynges gate and was in great dignity: yet was he now and then ſent away. Wherefore ſo long as the Monarchy of the <hi>Chaldees</hi> endured, <hi>Daniel</hi> was in no hie honour that laſted any ſpace: but vnder the Monarchy of the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Medes</hi> he proſpered &amp; was in continuall honor. For <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> were not ſo negligent to forget how meruailouſly God had wrought by hym. So was he in honour not onely wyth <hi>Darius,</hi> but alſo wyth <hi>Cyrus.</hi> And it is euident that he left <hi>Babylon</hi> &amp; went to ſome other place. Although it is not like that he was long amongeſt the <hi>Medes,</hi> for <hi>Darius</hi> or <hi>Cyaxeres</hi> died ſhortly after, and becauſe he wanted an heyre male, all his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity came to <hi>Cyrus</hi> alone, who was his nephew, the ſonne of his ſiſter, and alſo his ſonne in law by the mariage of hys daughter.</p>
                     <p>There is no doubt but that <hi>Daniel</hi> here commendeth the grace of God and his fauour towardes him. For thys was no ſmall comfort in his baniſhment, that he found ſuch fauour amongeſt ſtraunge and barbarous nations, and that he was in ſuch hie honour that all men did reuerence hym. God did mitigate the ſorow of his baniſhment and captiuity wyth thys comfort. Agayne <hi>Daniel</hi> doth not here regard hymſelfe onely as a priuate perſon, but the end of his honor. For God would haue his name to be renowned and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed throughout all thoſe countreyes where <hi>Daniel</hi> was wel knowne. For no man could caſt his eyes vpon <hi>Daniel</hi> but the glory and power of the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did appeare. Thys would <hi>Daniel</hi> note. In the meane tyme there is no doubt
<pb facs="tcp:7787:132"/> of the other ſide, but that the want of his countrey was bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and greuous vnto hym: not as it is wont to be to others, but becauſe the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was the peculiar heritage of the people of God.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Daniel</hi> therefore was caried away from thence, and afterward was caried farther, euen vnto the <hi>Medes,</hi> and in the end to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> ſo that there was no hope of returne: there is no doubt but that he mourned continually. For that great honour that he had amongeſt prophane men, was not ſo much eſtemed of him, but that he preferred that pledge of Gods fauour and fatherly adoption, that is to ſay, the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Doubtles he had that grauen in hys hart which was written before by <hi>Dauid:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 48.</note> 
                        <hi>I had rather to be a dore keper in the courtes of the Lord, then to be in the greatest wealth of the wicked.</hi> Agayne: <hi>I had rather to be in the houſe of God, then to dwell in the tentes of the wicked.</hi> So was <hi>Daniel</hi> taught. And <hi>Ezechiel</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezech. 14.</note> doth not name him in vayne amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt the thrée moſt holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which haue bene from the beginning of the world. This was a moſt hie commendation that he was ioyned with <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> euen whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was a young man, or at the leaſt in his midle age, ſo that he ſhould be the third in ſo rare and incredible holynes. Seing then he was ſuch a one, there is no doubt but that he was ſtricken with moſt greuous ſorow when he did ſée that he was appointed to perpetuall baniſhment, ſo that he had no hope of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, that he might worſhip God in his temple and offer ſacrifices with the reſidue. Yet leſt he ſhould be vnthankfull vnto God, he would here teſtify that he felt Gods ſingular fauour, that whereas he was an exile and baniſhed from his countrey, &amp; was alſo ſpitefully drawen away amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt other captiues, he was yet honorably entreated of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Medes</hi> &amp; the <hi>Perſians.</hi> This is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ful meaning. For it is certaine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Cyrus</hi> after <hi>Darius</hi> was dead (as I haue ſaid) was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſucceſſor of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole Monarchy, &amp; we ſhall ſée afterward y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Daniel</hi> dwelt with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who raigned almoſt <hi>30.</hi> yeares: and ſo there was a long tyme betwixt his death &amp; the death of <hi>Darius.</hi>

                     <p>Wherfore this came not to paſſe without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meruaylous counſell of God, that the chaunge of the kingdomes did not ſhake the ſtate of <hi>Daniel,</hi> as it is often ſéene.
